# PRD Creation Slash Command

## Instructions

You are helping create a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a new feature. This process involves two components:

1. **GitHub Issue**: Short, immutable concept description that links to the detailed PRD
2. **PRD File**: Detailed requirements document stored in `prds/` directory with comprehensive checkbox tracking

## Process

### Step 1: Understand the Feature Concept
Ask the user to describe the feature idea to understand the core concept and scope.

### Step 2: Create GitHub Issue FIRST
Create the GitHub issue immediately to get the issue ID. This ID is required for proper PRD file naming.

### Step 3: Create PRD File with Correct Naming
Create the PRD file using the actual GitHub issue ID: `prds/[issue-id]-[feature-name].md`

### Step 4: Update GitHub Issue with PRD Link
Add the PRD file link to the GitHub issue description now that the filename is known.

### Step 5: Create Detailed PRD Through Discussion
Work through each section of the PRD template below with the user. **Discuss each section** to ensure clarity and completeness before moving to the next.

## GitHub Issue Template (Keep Short & Stable)

**Initial Issue Creation (without PRD link):**
```markdown
## PRD: [Feature Name]

**Problem**: [1-2 sentence problem description]

**Solution**: [1-2 sentence solution overview]

**Detailed PRD**: Will be added after PRD file creation

**Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]
```

**Issue Update (after PRD file created):**
```markdown
## PRD: [Feature Name]

**Problem**: [1-2 sentence problem description]

**Solution**: [1-2 sentence solution overview]

**Detailed PRD**: See [prds/[actual-issue-id]-[feature-name].md](./prds/[actual-issue-id]-[feature-name].md)

## Discussion Guidelines

### For Each Section, Ask:
1. **Problem Statement**: "What specific problems are users/stakeholders facing? Can you give me concrete examples of the current pain points?"
2. **Solution**: "How do you envision this solution working? Walk me through the key workflows and interactions."
3. **User Stories**: "Who are the different types of users? What are their specific needs, contexts, and goals?"
4. **Requirements**: "What are the must-have capabilities vs nice-to-have? Let's prioritize ruthlessly based on user value."
5. **Success Criteria**: "How will we measure success? What specific, measurable outcomes will indicate this is working?"
6. **Implementation**: "How should we break this into phases? What's the minimum viable version that delivers real value?"
7. **Dependencies**: "What external systems, teams, or resources do we depend on? What could block progress?"
8. **Risks**: "What could go wrong? What are the biggest risks to success and how can we mitigate them?"
9. **Scope**: "What should we explicitly NOT include in version 1? What's out of scope to prevent scope creep?"

### Discussion Tips:
- **Clarify ambiguity**: If something isn't clear, ask follow-up questions until you understand
- **Challenge assumptions**: Help the user think through edge cases, alternatives, and unintended consequences
- **Prioritize ruthlessly**: Help distinguish between must-have and nice-to-have based on user impact
- **Think about users**: Always bring the conversation back to user value, experience, and outcomes
- **Consider feasibility**: While not diving into implementation details, ensure scope is realistic
- **Plan for tracking**: Ensure requirements are specific and measurable enough to checkbox when complete
- **Think cross-functionally**: Consider impact on different teams, systems, and stakeholders

## Checkbox Legend
- `[ ]` - Not started / Pending
- `[x]` - Completed 
- `[~]` - Deferred to future phase/version
- `[!]` - Blocked (needs resolution)

## Status Indicators
- üîÑ **IN PROGRESS** - Active work happening
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Phase/section finished
- ‚è≥ **PENDING** - Not yet started
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **PAUSED** - Temporarily stopped
- ‚ùå **CANCELLED** - No longer planned

## Workflow

1. **Concept Discussion**: Get the basic idea and validate the need
2. **Create GitHub Issue FIRST**: Short, stable concept description to get issue ID
3. **Create PRD File**: Detailed document using actual issue ID: `prds/[issue-id]-[feature-name].md`
4. **Update GitHub Issue**: Add link to PRD file now that filename is known
5. **Section-by-Section Discussion**: Work through each template section systematically
6. **Checkbox Population**: Ensure all trackable items have checkboxes
7. **Review & Validation**: Ensure completeness and clarity

**CRITICAL**: Steps 2-4 must happen in this exact order to avoid the chicken-and-egg problem of needing the issue ID for the filename.

## File Management

```bash
# 1. Create GitHub issue FIRST to get issue ID (without PRD link)
gh issue create --title "PRD: [Feature Name]" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## PRD: [Feature Name]

**Problem**: [1-2 sentence problem description]

**Solution**: [1-2 sentence solution overview]

**Detailed PRD**: Will be added after PRD file creation

**Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]
EOF
)" --label PRD

# Note the returned issue URL to extract the ID (e.g., if URL ends with /issues/28, then ID is 28)

# 2. Create prds directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p prds

# 3. Create the PRD file using the actual issue ID from step 1
touch prds/[actual-issue-id]-[feature-name].md

# 4. Update GitHub issue to add PRD link now that filename is known
gh issue edit [actual-issue-id] --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## PRD: [Feature Name]

**Problem**: [1-2 sentence problem description]

**Solution**: [1-2 sentence solution overview]

**Detailed PRD**: See [prds/[actual-issue-id]-[feature-name].md](./prds/[actual-issue-id]-[feature-name].md)

**Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]
EOF
)"
```

## Example Output

**GitHub Issue** (concise, stable):
```markdown
## PRD: Documentation Testing System

**Problem**: Documentation often contains outdated commands and broken examples that mislead users.

**Solution**: AI-powered system that validates documentation by executing commands and testing examples.

**Detailed PRD**: See [prds/12-documentation-testing.md](./prds/12-documentation-testing.md)

**Priority**: High
