# PRD Done - Complete Implementation Workflow

This command provides instructions for completing a PRD (Product Requirements Document) implementation by creating a branch, pushing changes, creating a PR, and merging.

## Instructions

### 1. Create Branch (if needed)

If you haven't already created a feature branch for this PRD:

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/prd-[issue-number]-[brief-description]

# Example:
git checkout -b feature/prd-23-metadata-storage
```

### 2. Update Documentation

Ensure all documentation is current before committing:

```bash
# Check README.md and all linked documentation files
# Update CLAUDE.md if needed for new workflows or patterns
# Update any relevant documentation in docs/ directory
# Ensure inline code comments are comprehensive
# Verify all examples and command references are accurate
```

### 3. Push Changes to Branch

Commit and push your implementation to the branch:

```bash
# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: implement [PRD feature description]

Implements PRD #[issue-number]: [brief description]

- [Key change 1]
- [Key change 2]
- [Key change 3]

# Push to remote
git push -u origin feature/prd-[issue-number]-[brief-description]
```

### 4. Create Pull Request

Create a PR that references the PRD/issue:

```bash
gh pr create --title "feat: implement [PRD feature description]" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary

```

### 5. Verify CI and Automated Checks

Before merging, ensure all automated systems have validated the changes:

**Check CI Status:**
```bash
# Generic approach - check PR status in your system
gh pr view [pr-number]  # Shows all check status regardless of CI provider
gh pr checks [pr-number]  # Lists all status checks

# Or check via web interface if using other platforms
# - GitLab: Check pipeline status in merge request
# - Bitbucket: Check build status in pull request  
# - Azure DevOps: Check build validation in PR
```

**Common Validations to Verify:**
- âœ… **Build/Compilation**: Code compiles successfully
- âœ… **Test Suite**: All automated tests pass
- âœ… **Code Quality**: Linting/formatting checks pass
- âœ… **Security**: Vulnerability scans complete
- âœ… **Coverage**: Test coverage meets requirements

**If Checks Fail:**
```bash
# Fix issues and update PR
git add [fixed-files]
git commit -m "fix: address CI feedback"
git push origin [branch-name]

# Wait for checks to re-run, then proceed
```

### 6. Merge Pull Request

Only merge after ALL automated checks pass:

```bash
# If auto-merge is enabled and checks pass, it will merge automatically
# Otherwise, manually merge (this deletes the remote branch):
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch

# Switch to main branch and pull merged changes
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Delete local branch (if it still exists)
git branch -d feature/prd-[issue-number]-[brief-description]

# Or merge via web interface if preferred
```

### 6. Close PRD/Issue

Close the related issue with completion summary:

```bash
gh issue close [issue-number] --comment "âœ… PRD implementation completed successfully.

**Completed in PR:** #[pr-number]

**Key Features Implemented:**
- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]
- [Feature 3]

**Testing Status:** All tests passing ([X] total)

**Status:** Ready for production use.

```

## Tips

- **Use descriptive branch names** that include the PRD/issue number
- **Write clear commit messages** that explain the implementation
- **Reference the PRD/issue** in PR descriptions for traceability
- **Include testing status** in all communications
- **Use consistent formatting** for professional appearance
- **Delete feature branches** after merging to keep repo clean
