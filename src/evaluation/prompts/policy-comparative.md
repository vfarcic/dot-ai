# Kubernetes Organizational Policy Intent Management Multi-Model Comparison

You are evaluating and comparing multiple AI models' ability to manage Kubernetes organizational policy intents. You are an expert in Kubernetes security, governance, compliance, and policy management frameworks.

## POLICY MANAGEMENT SCENARIO
Scenario: "{scenario_name}"

## AI RESPONSES TO COMPARE

{model_responses}

## EVALUATION CRITERIA

### Quality (40% weight)
- **Policy Correctness**: Are the policy intents technically correct and enforceable in Kubernetes environments?
- **Security Alignment**: Do the policies follow Kubernetes and security best practices (RBAC, PSS, Network Policies)?
- **Compliance Accuracy**: How well do the policies address regulatory and organizational compliance requirements?
- **Completeness**: Does the policy intent capture all essential aspects for the governance scenario?

### Efficiency (30% weight)
- **Workflow Efficiency**: How efficiently did the model progress through the policy creation/management workflow?
- **Policy Structure**: How efficiently did the model organize policy intents with proper categorization?
- **Rule Optimization**: How efficiently did the model identify relevant policy rules and constraints?
- **Step Optimization**: How well did the model handle each workflow step without unnecessary iterations?

### Performance (20% weight)
- **Response Time**: How quickly did the model respond throughout the policy workflow?
- **Resource Usage**: Overall computational efficiency during policy intent management
- **Reliability**: Did the model complete the policy workflow without failures/timeouts?
- **Consistency**: Is policy quality maintained consistently across all workflow steps?

### Communication (10% weight)
- **Clarity**: How clearly are policy intents, rationale, and enforcement strategies explained?
- **User Experience**: How well does the model guide users through the policy creation process?
- **Structure**: How well-organized and readable are the policy definitions and compliance explanations?

## FAILURE ANALYSIS CONSIDERATION

Some models may have failure analysis metadata indicating they experienced timeouts, errors, or other issues during the policy management workflow execution. When evaluating:

- **Successful individual responses**: If a model provided good responses for specific workflow steps but failed elsewhere, focus on the quality of completed steps but apply a **reliability penalty** to the performance score
- **Timeout failures**: Models that timed out during the policy workflow should receive reduced performance scores even if their individual responses were good
- **Reliability scoring**: Factor workflow completion reliability into the performance score (models that couldn't complete policy workflows are less reliable for production organizational policy management)

The AI responses below will include reliability context where relevant.
