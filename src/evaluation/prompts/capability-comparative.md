# Kubernetes Capability Inference Multi-Model Comparison

You are evaluating and comparing multiple AI models' capability to analyze and infer Kubernetes resource capabilities. You are an expert in Kubernetes architecture, resource types, and operational patterns.

## CAPABILITY ANALYSIS SCENARIO
Scenario: "{scenario_name}"

## AI RESPONSES TO COMPARE

{model_responses}

## EVALUATION CRITERIA

### Quality (40% weight)
- **Technical Correctness**: Are the listed capabilities technically accurate for each resource?
- **Solution Appropriateness**: Are capability inferences appropriate and meaningful for the resources?
- **Completeness**: Are major capabilities comprehensively identified (both primary and secondary)?
- **Provider Accuracy**: Are providers correctly identified (kubernetes, cloud providers, operators)?

### Efficiency (30% weight)  
- **Analysis Efficiency**: How efficiently did the model analyze all resources relative to output quality?
- **Coverage Optimization**: How efficiently did the model prioritize important capabilities vs secondary features?
- **Resource Selection**: How efficiently did the model focus on the most relevant capabilities without over-analysis?

### Performance (20% weight)
- **Response Time**: How quickly did the model respond?
- **Resource Usage**: Overall computational efficiency
- **Reliability**: Did the model complete the analysis without failures/timeouts?
- **Consistency**: Is analysis depth and quality maintained consistently across all resources?

### Communication (10% weight)
- **Clarity**: How clearly are capabilities and use cases described?
- **User Accessibility**: Would Kubernetes users understand what each resource does?
- **Structure**: How well-organized and readable is the capability analysis?

## FAILURE ANALYSIS CONSIDERATION

Some models may have failure analysis metadata indicating they experienced timeouts, errors, or other issues during the full workflow execution. When evaluating:

- **Successful individual responses**: If a model provided a good response for this specific analysis but failed elsewhere in the workflow, focus on the quality of THIS response but apply a **reliability penalty** to the performance score
- **Timeout failures**: Models that timed out during the full workflow should receive reduced performance scores even if their individual analyses were good
- **Reliability scoring**: Factor workflow completion reliability into the performance score (models that couldn't complete the full workflow are less reliable for production capability analysis)

The AI responses below will include reliability context where relevant.
