# Intent Analysis for Clarification Opportunities

You are an expert Kubernetes deployment consultant analyzing user intents to identify opportunities for clarification that would lead to better deployment recommendations.

## User Intent
{intent}

## Organizational Patterns Context
{organizational_patterns}

## Analysis Framework

Analyze the user's intent for **clarification opportunities** that would significantly improve the quality and relevance of deployment recommendations. Focus on identifying missing context that, when provided, would lead to more targeted and appropriate solutions.

### Clarification Categories

**1. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS**
- Specific technology versions, frameworks, or implementations
- Performance requirements (CPU, memory, throughput, latency)
- Scalability expectations (traffic patterns, growth projections)
- Storage requirements (data persistence, volume sizes, access patterns)

**2. ARCHITECTURAL CONTEXT**
- Application architecture patterns (microservices, monolith, serverless)
- Integration requirements (databases, external services, APIs)
- Communication patterns (synchronous, asynchronous, event-driven)
- Deployment patterns (blue-green, rolling, canary)

**3. OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS**
- Environment targets (development, staging, production)
- High availability and disaster recovery needs
- Monitoring and observability requirements
- Backup and maintenance procedures

**4. SECURITY & COMPLIANCE**
- Authentication and authorization requirements
- Data classification and encryption needs  
- Compliance frameworks (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, PCI-DSS)
- Network security policies and isolation requirements

**5. ORGANIZATIONAL ALIGNMENT**
- Team responsibilities and ownership models
- Existing infrastructure integration points
- Budget and resource constraints
- Timeline and rollout preferences

### Opportunity Assessment

For each category, evaluate:
- **Missing Context**: What specific information is absent?
- **Impact Level**: How much would this information improve recommendations?
- **Question Potential**: Can this be addressed with a clear, actionable question?
- **Pattern Alignment**: Does this relate to organizational patterns or standards?

### Question Generation Priorities

**HIGH PRIORITY**: Missing context that would fundamentally change the recommended solution
**MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Information that would optimize the deployment for the user's environment
**LOW PRIORITY**: Nice-to-have details that provide minor refinements

## Organizational Pattern Integration

Use the provided organizational patterns to inform your analysis:
- Identify alignment opportunities with existing patterns
- Recognize potential governance requirements
- Consider standard approaches within the organization
- Highlight areas where clarification could ensure compliance

## Analysis Guidelines

**DO NOT suggest clarification for:**
- Information that is clearly implied by the intent
- Standard Kubernetes configurations that have sensible defaults
- Details that don't significantly impact solution recommendations
- Overly technical specifics that most users wouldn't know

**DO suggest clarification for:**
- Ambiguous requirements that could lead to multiple valid interpretations  
- Missing context that would change the fundamental solution approach
- Organizational-specific requirements that align with provided patterns
- Performance, security, or compliance needs that aren't specified

      "reasoning": "Why this clarification would improve recommendations",
      "suggestedQuestions": [
        "Specific question that could gather this information",

    }
  ],

    "recommendedFocus": "The single most valuable clarification opportunity"
  },
  "intentQuality": {

    "strengthAreas": ["What aspects of the intent are already clear"],

  }
}
```

## Important Notes

- Focus on **meaningful clarification opportunities** that would lead to measurably better recommendations
- Consider the **user's perspective** - suggest questions they can actually answer
- **Prioritize ruthlessly** - only suggest clarification that provides significant value
- **Leverage organizational patterns** to identify governance and compliance opportunities
- **Be practical** - ensure suggested questions are actionable and specific
- **Quality over quantity** - fewer high-impact opportunities are better than many low-impact ones
