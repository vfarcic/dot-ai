This documentation testing session is now complete. The session data has been saved and can be referenced for future improvements.

**Key Points:**
- **Fixed items** have been successfully resolved and won't appear in future testing sessions
- **Deferred items** (including ignored items with `dotai-ignore` comments) won't appear in future sessions 
- **Pending items** can be addressed in a new testing session by running the same commands again

## Starting a New Session

```bash
# Test the same file again (will skip ignored items)
dot-ai test-docs --file {filePath}

# Test a different documentation file  
dot-ai test-docs --file path/to/other/docs.md

# Or use discovery mode to find available documentation
dot-ai test-docs
```

## Session Data Location
