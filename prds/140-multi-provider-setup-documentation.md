# PRD: Multi-Provider AI Setup Documentation

**Status**: üî¥ Blocked - Awaiting Performance Improvements
**Priority**: Low (Blocked)
**GitHub Issue**: [#140](https://github.com/vfarcic/dot-ai/issues/140)
**Created**: 2025-10-05
**Dependencies**:
- [PRD 73: Multi-Model AI Provider Support](./73-multi-model-ai-provider-support.md) (Implementation Complete)
- [PRD 139: AI Provider Comparison & Benchmarking](./139-ai-provider-comparison-benchmarking.md) (Data Source)

## Executive Summary

The DevOps AI Toolkit has implemented multi-provider AI support (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini) with a complete AIProvider abstraction and integration test suite. However, alternative providers (OpenAI, Gemini) have significant performance issues compared to Anthropic Claude, making them unsuitable for production use. This PRD defers user-facing documentation until next-generation models address these performance gaps.

### Current State
- **Implementation**: ‚úÖ Complete (PRD 73)
  - AIProvider interface fully implemented
  - AnthropicProvider: 100% tests passing, 17 min test duration
  - VercelProvider (OpenAI + Gemini): Code complete, tests passing
- **Performance Testing**: ‚úÖ Complete
  - Anthropic Claude Sonnet: 17 min (baseline)
  - Google Gemini 2.5 Pro: 52 min (3x slower)
  - OpenAI GPT-5: 2-3x slower, 91% pass rate
- **Documentation**: ‚ùå Intentionally deferred until performance improves

### Problem Statement
- **Feature exists but is undocumented**: Users cannot discover multi-provider capability
- **Performance not production-ready**: Alternative providers too slow for real-world usage
- **Premature documentation risk**: Documenting slow providers creates bad user experience
- **Waiting for next-gen models**: Gemini 3, GPT-6 expected to improve performance significantly

### Solution Overview
Defer user-facing documentation until alternative AI providers meet performance criteria. When triggered by next-gen model releases:
1. Test new models using existing integration test suite
2. Compare performance against Anthropic baseline using PRD 139 benchmarks
3. Document providers that meet acceptance criteria
4. Provide setup instructions enabling users to choose optimal provider

## Blocking Conditions & Triggers

### Current Blockers
1. **Google Gemini Performance**: 3x slower than Anthropic (52 min vs 17 min test suite)
2. **OpenAI Performance**: 2-3x slower than Anthropic, 91% pass rate (40/44 tests)

### Unblock Triggers
Documentation work begins when **ANY** provider meets these criteria:
- ‚úÖ Test suite duration within 2x of Anthropic baseline (<34 min)
- ‚úÖ 95%+ integration test pass rate (42+/44 tests)
- ‚úÖ No critical functionality failures
- ‚úÖ Benchmark results show consistent performance (PRD 139)

### Expected Timeline
- **Gemini 3**: Expected 2025 Q1-Q2 (speculative)
- **GPT-6 / GPT-5 improvements**: Expected 2025 (speculative)
- **Model updates**: Providers frequently release improved models
- **Opportunistic testing**: Test new models as they're announced

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Documentation Completeness**: 100% of setup steps documented
- **Link Validity**: 0 broken external links
- **Setup Time**: Users configure alternative provider in <5 minutes
- **Accuracy**: Environment variable examples work without modification

### User Experience Metrics
- **Self-Service Success**: 90%+ users configure providers without support requests
- **Provider Adoption**: 20%+ users try alternative providers after documentation
- **Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on clarity and completeness
- **Issue Resolution**: <5 documentation-related issues reported

### Business Impact
- **Feature Discovery**: Users aware multi-provider support exists
- **Cost Optimization**: Users can choose cost-effective providers
- **Flexibility**: Users not locked into single vendor
- **Adoption Confidence**: Clear performance data drives adoption

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks

1. **Models Never Improve**: Next-gen models fail to meet performance criteria
   - **Mitigation**: Keep documentation blocked indefinitely, architecture still valuable
   - **Alternative**: Document with clear "experimental, slow" warnings if user demand is high

2. **Documentation Drift**: Providers change APIs, documentation becomes stale
   - **Mitigation**: Link to provider docs for details, keep our docs minimal
   - **Monitoring**: Quarterly review of external links and provider changes

3. **User Confusion**: Users try slow providers, have bad experience
   - **Mitigation**: Clear performance warnings in documentation
   - **Guidance**: Strong recommendation to use Anthropic until benchmarks show parity

### Medium Priority Risks

1. **Incomplete Testing**: New models have edge cases not covered by tests
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive integration test suite catches most issues
   - **Follow-up**: Monitor real-world usage, iterate based on feedback

2. **Cost Surprises**: Users don't understand pricing differences
   - **Mitigation**: Clear cost guidance linking to provider pricing pages
   - **Warning**: Emphasize importance of checking provider pricing

3. **Provider Availability**: Regional restrictions, API key access issues
   - **Mitigation**: Document known limitations, provider-specific troubleshooting
   - **Support**: Link to provider support channels for account issues

## Documentation Dependencies

### Documentation to Create
- `docs/ai-providers-guide.md` - Primary multi-provider setup guide (NEW)

### Documentation to Update

- **Use Case Examples**: Real-world provider selection scenarios
- **Troubleshooting Contributions**: Community-added solutions

## Decision Log

### ‚úÖ Decision: Defer Documentation Until Performance Improves
- **Date**: 2025-10-05
- **Decision**: Do not document alternative providers until they meet performance criteria
- **Rationale**:
  - Current performance gaps (2-3x slower) create poor user experience
  - Documenting slow features risks damaging project reputation
  - Implementation is complete and tested, just needs better models
  - Documentation is fast to create (3-4 days) when unblocked
  - Next-gen models expected in 2025 may resolve performance issues
- **Impact**: PRD marked as "Blocked", no immediate work required
- **Trigger**: Test new models when released, document if they meet criteria
- **Owner**: Project Maintainers

### ‚úÖ Decision: Link to Provider Docs for Details
- **Date**: 2025-10-05
- **Decision**: Keep documentation minimal, link to provider docs for specifics
- **Rationale**:
  - Pricing changes frequently, provider docs are authoritative
  - Model features vary, provider docs have complete details
  - Account setup is provider-specific, link to their instructions
  - Reduces maintenance burden, prevents documentation drift
  - Focus our docs on integration-specific setup only
- **Impact**: Smaller documentation scope, more maintainable
- **Owner**: Documentation Contributors

### ‚úÖ Decision: Flexible Acceptance Criteria
- **Date**: 2025-10-05
- **Decision**: Use "within 2x of Anthropic" rather than fixed performance targets
- **Rationale**:
  - Anthropic performance may improve over time
  - Relative comparison more meaningful than absolute numbers
  - Allows for future optimization of baseline
  - Focuses on user-acceptable performance gap
  - 2x slower still provides value if baseline improves
- **Impact**: Documentation criteria adaptive to future improvements
- **Owner**: Project Maintainers

## Work Log

### 2025-10-05: PRD Created - Documentation Deferred
**Duration**: ~1 hour
**Phase**: Planning and Requirements

**Context**:
- PRD 73 implementation complete, all providers working
- Integration tests reveal significant performance gaps:
  - Anthropic Claude: 17 min baseline
  - Google Gemini: 52 min (3x slower)
  - OpenAI GPT-5: 2-3x slower, 91% pass rate
- Architecture is production-ready, models are not

**Decision**:
- Defer user-facing documentation until performance improves
- Keep implementation in production (undocumented)
- Wait for next-gen models (Gemini 3, GPT-6)
- Create PRD to track documentation readiness

**Activities**:
- Created GitHub issue #140
- Defined blocking conditions and unblock triggers
- Documented acceptance criteria (2x performance, 95%+ tests)
- Designed documentation scope and structure
- Established 6-milestone delivery plan (ready to execute when unblocked)

**Next Steps**:
- Monitor AI provider announcements for new model releases
- Test new models against integration suite when available
- Unblock documentation if performance criteria met
- Update PRD 73 to reference this deferred documentation PRD

**Current Status**: üî¥ Blocked - Awaiting next-gen model releases
