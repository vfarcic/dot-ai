## Dependencies & Blockers

### External Dependencies
- [ ] MCP SDK prompt handling capabilities (already available)
- [ ] Claude Code MCP client prompt integration (already supported)
- [ ] Standard MCP Prompts specification compliance

### Internal Dependencies
- [ ] Existing MCP server infrastructure (src/mcp/server.ts) - ✅ Available
- [ ] MCP server registration and capability system - ✅ Available
- [ ] TypeScript build and development environment - ✅ Available

### Current Blockers
- [ ] None currently identified - all dependencies are satisfied

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
- [ ] **Risk**: Prompt naming conflicts with existing commands | **Mitigation**: Use consistent `mcp__dot-ai__` prefix, test naming | **Owner**: Developer
- [ ] **Risk**: Large prompt content impacting performance | **Mitigation**: Set reasonable prompt size limits, implement caching | **Owner**: Developer  
- [ ] **Risk**: Team adoption resistance due to unfamiliarity | **Mitigation**: Clear documentation, gradual rollout, training | **Owner**: Team Lead
- [ ] **Risk**: Prompt quality inconsistency | **Mitigation**: Establish review process, prompt templates, guidelines | **Owner**: Curator

### Mitigation Actions
- [ ] Create prompt contribution guidelines and review process
- [ ] Implement prompt size and format validation
- [ ] Develop comprehensive documentation and examples
- [ ] Plan gradual team introduction with high-value prompts first

## Decision Log

### Open Questions
- [ ] What prompt categories should we implement initially? (code-review, documentation, architecture, debugging)
- [ ] Should we support prompt parameters/arguments in v1 or keep strictly static?
- [ ] What's the ideal prompt storage format - separate files vs embedded data?
- [ ] How should we handle prompt versioning and updates?
- [ ] Do MCP prompts work similarly in Cursor, VS Code, and other coding agents as they do in Claude Code?
- [ ] Are there client-specific differences in prompt naming, discovery, or execution that we need to accommodate?

### Resolved Decisions
- [x] Use standard MCP Prompts specification - **Decided**: 2025-01-22 **Rationale**: Standardized approach, native Claude Code integration
- [x] Target native slash command experience - **Decided**: 2025-01-22 **Rationale**: Research confirmed MCP prompts become `/mcp__servername__prompt` commands
- [x] Static prompts only for v1 - **Decided**: 2025-01-22 **Rationale**: Simpler implementation, clear scope, meets core need
- [x] Build on existing dot-ai MCP server - **Decided**: 2025-01-22 **Rationale**: Leverage existing infrastructure, single server deployment

## Scope Management

### In Scope (Current Version)
- [x] Static prompts only (no dynamic arguments)
- [x] New standalone prompts (separate from existing workflow prompts)
- [x] Standard MCP Prompts implementation (`prompts/list`, `prompts/get`)
- [x] Native slash command integration (`/mcp__dot-ai__*`)
- [x] Basic prompt organization and metadata
- [x] File-based prompt storage
- [x] Integration with existing dot-ai MCP server

### Out of Scope (Future Versions)
- [~] Dynamic prompt arguments/parameters
- [~] Integration with existing workflow prompts (recommend, generate, etc.)
- [~] Web-based prompt management UI
- [~] Prompt analytics and usage tracking
- [~] User-submitted prompt contributions
- [~] Prompt versioning and history

### Deferred Items
- [~] Advanced prompt search and filtering - **Reason**: Complex for v1, basic list sufficient initially **Target**: Phase 3
- [~] Prompt contribution workflow - **Reason**: Need to establish core library first **Target**: Future version
- [~] Usage analytics - **Reason**: Focus on core functionality first **Target**: Phase 3
- [~] Prompt templates with parameters - **Reason**: Static prompts meet immediate need **Target**: v2.0

## Appendix

### Supporting Materials
- [MCP Prompts Specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/prompts)
- [Claude Code MCP Integration Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp)
- [Existing dot-ai MCP Server Implementation](./src/mcp/server.ts)

### Research Findings
- MCP prompts automatically become native slash commands in Claude Code
- Format: `/mcp__servername__promptname` 
- Users can discover prompts by typing `/` in Claude Code
- Prompts work identically to `.claude/commands/` but with centralized management
- No client-side setup required - prompts available immediately upon MCP server connection

### Example Prompt Structure
```json
{
  "id": "code-review-security",
  "name": "Security-Focused Code Review",
  "description": "Comprehensive security analysis prompt for code review",
  "category": "code-review",
  "content": "Please review this code with focus on security vulnerabilities..."
}
