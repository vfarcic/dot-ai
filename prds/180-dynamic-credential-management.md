## Problem Statement

The DevOps AI Toolkit MCP server currently relies exclusively on environment variables for credentials (Kubernetes config, Anthropic API keys, OpenAI API keys, etc.). This design prevents several critical deployment scenarios:

**Current Limitations:**
- Cannot run a single MCP server instance serving multiple users with different credentials
- Cannot support remote/hosted MCP deployments where users connect with their own cluster access
- Forces credential sharing when multiple users want to use the same MCP instance
- No support for dynamic credential switching without server restart

**User Impact:**
- Teams cannot deploy a shared MCP service that respects individual user access controls
- Enterprise deployments blocked due to credential isolation requirements
- Developers must run local MCP instances even when centralized deployment would be more efficient
- No way to audit which user performed which operations with which credentials

## Proposed Solution

Implement a **layered credential resolution system** that supports both local and remote deployment models:

### Deployment Model 1: Local Single-User (Current Behavior)
- Uses environment variables exclusively
- No changes to existing workflow
- Credentials loaded at server startup

### Deployment Model 2: Remote Multi-User (New Capability)
- Server starts with optional "shared" credentials via environment variables (e.g., shared Anthropic API key)
- Clients provide additional/override credentials during MCP connection handshake
- Per-connection credential isolation in memory
- Audit trail of credential usage by connection/user

### Key Design Principles

**Layered Resolution:**
```
Final Credential = ENV_VAR (default) ?? CLIENT_PROVIDED (override)
```

**Example Scenarios:**
1. **Shared AI, Individual Clusters**: Company sets `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in env, users provide their kubeconfig during connection
2. **All Individual**: User provides both Anthropic key and kubeconfig during connection
3. **Legacy Local**: User sets all env vars, no client-provided credentials needed (current behavior)

**Security Requirements:**
- âœ… Credential isolation between connections
- âœ… Encryption in transit (TLS for credential transmission)
- âœ… No credential persistence to disk
- âœ… Audit logging (who accessed what with which credentials)
- âœ… Credential validation before use
- âœ… Automatic credential cleanup on connection close

## Success Criteria

### Must Have (MVP)
- [ ] MCP client can provide credentials during connection initialization
- [ ] Layered credential resolution working (env vars + client overrides)
- [ ] Credential isolation: one connection's credentials never leak to another
- [ ] Support for at minimum: Kubernetes config, Anthropic API key
- [ ] Audit logging: track which connection used which credentials for which operations
- [ ] Integration tests validating multi-user scenarios
- [ ] Documentation for setting up remote multi-user deployments

### Nice to Have (Future)
- [ ] Support for OpenAI API keys, Vector DB credentials
- [ ] Credential caching/reuse within a connection session
- [ ] Admin API to view active connections and credential types (not values)
- [ ] Rate limiting per credential set
- [ ] Credential expiration/rotation support
- [ ] OAuth/OIDC integration for user identity

### Success Metrics
- Single MCP server can handle 10+ concurrent users with different credentials
- Zero credential leakage incidents in security testing
- Audit logs successfully trace all operations to user credentials
- Documentation enables team deployment within 15 minutes

## User Journey

### Current State (Before)
1. DevOps engineer wants to use MCP with their cluster
2. Must set environment variables: `KUBECONFIG`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, etc.
3. Starts local MCP server instance
4. Connects Claude Code to local MCP server
5. **Problem**: Colleague wants to use MCP with different cluster â†’ must run separate server instance

### Future State (After)
1. Company deploys shared MCP server with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable
2. DevOps engineer installs Claude Code
3. Configures Claude Code MCP connection with:
   - Remote MCP server URL (e.g., `https://mcp.company.com`)
   - Personal Kubernetes config file path
4. Claude Code establishes connection, sending kubeconfig during handshake
5. Engineer uses MCP tools - operations use their kubeconfig + shared Anthropic key
6. **Benefit**: Colleague connects to same server with their own kubeconfig â†’ works independently

### User Personas

**Persona 1: Enterprise Platform Team**
- Wants to deploy centralized MCP service for 50+ developers
- Needs each developer to use their own Kubernetes cluster credentials
- Wants to provide shared Anthropic API key to control costs
- Requires audit trail for compliance

**Persona 2: Solo Developer (Existing User)**
- Uses MCP locally with environment variables
- Doesn't want workflow disruption
- Should see no changes unless opting into remote deployment

**Persona 3: SaaS Provider**
- Wants to offer MCP as a service to customers
- Each customer brings their own cluster credentials
- Needs strong isolation guarantees
- Requires per-customer rate limiting and usage tracking

## Technical Scope

### Core Components to Modify

**1. MCP Protocol Layer (`src/interfaces/mcp.ts`)**
- Extend MCP initialization to accept credential payload
- Implement credential validation and parsing
- Add credential encryption for transit (TLS enforcement)

**2. Core Service Layer (New: `src/core/credential-manager.ts`)**
- Credential resolution logic (env vars + client overrides)
- Per-connection credential storage (in-memory only)
- Credential isolation enforcement
- Automatic cleanup on connection close

**3. Kubernetes Client Layer (`src/core/kubernetes.ts`)**
- Modify to accept per-request credentials instead of global config
- Support both kubeconfig content and file path
- Validate kubeconfig before use

**4. AI Integration Layer (`src/core/claude.ts`, OpenAI equivalent)**
- Modify to accept per-request API keys
- Support credential override from connection context

**5. Audit Logging (New: `src/core/audit-logger.ts`)**
- Log credential usage events (connection, operations, disconnection)
- Never log credential values, only metadata (hash, type, timestamp)
- Support structured logging for SIEM integration

**6. MCP Client Updates**
- Add credential configuration to Claude Code MCP settings
- UI/config for specifying which credentials to send
- Secure credential storage in client (OS keychain integration)

### Integration Points

**Existing Systems:**
- âœ… Kubernetes client library (needs per-request credential support)
- âœ… Claude AI SDK (already supports per-request API keys)
- âœ… OpenAI SDK (needs verification of per-request API key support)
- âœ… Qdrant client (future: needs per-request credential support)
- âœ… MCP protocol specification (may need extension proposal)

**New Systems:**
- ðŸ†• Credential encryption/decryption (TLS layer)
- ðŸ†• Audit log storage (file-based initially, database optional)
- ðŸ†• Connection management (track active connections + credentials)

### Technical Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Credential Leakage Between Connections**
- **Mitigation**: Strong isolation using per-connection context objects, comprehensive security testing
- **Validation**: Integration tests with concurrent users, security audit

**Risk 2: MCP Protocol Extension Not Standardized**
- **Mitigation**: Use MCP's initialization options if possible, propose extension to MCP spec if needed
- **Fallback**: Custom handshake after MCP connection but before tool calls

**Risk 3: Performance Overhead from Per-Request Credential Resolution**
- **Mitigation**: Cache resolved credentials per connection, benchmark performance impact
- **Acceptance Criteria**: <10ms overhead per request

**Risk 4: Kubernetes Client Library Limitations**
- **Mitigation**: Research `@kubernetes/client-node` support for dynamic config switching
- **Fallback**: Create separate client instances per connection (acceptable for MVP)

**Risk 5: Credential Storage in Claude Code Client**
- **Mitigation**: Use OS keychain APIs, document security best practices
- **Note**: This is primarily a client-side concern, server design should be agnostic

## Dependencies

**Internal Dependencies:**
- None blocking - this is a core infrastructure change

**External Dependencies:**
- MCP protocol specification review (may need community input for extension)
- `@kubernetes/client-node` library capabilities for dynamic config
- Claude Code client updates (if extending MCP protocol significantly)

**Documentation Dependencies:**
- Update MCP server setup documentation
- Create remote deployment guide
- Document credential configuration patterns

## Open Questions

### 1. MCP Protocol Extension
**Question**: Does the MCP protocol specification support custom initialization parameters for credentials, or do we need to propose an extension?

**Research Needed**: Review MCP spec, check with community

**Decision Point**: Week 1 (Milestone 1)

---

### 2. Credential Types Priority
**Question**: Which credential types should be supported in MVP vs deferred to future releases?

**Options**:
- MVP: Kubernetes config + Anthropic API key only
- MVP: All current credentials (add OpenAI, Qdrant)

**Current Thinking**: Start with Kubernetes + Anthropic (most critical for enterprise use case), add others in follow-up

**Decision Point**: Week 1 (Milestone 1)

---

### 3. Credential Transmission Format
**Question**: How should credentials be serialized for transmission?

**Options**:
- JSON object in MCP initialization params
- Base64-encoded credential bundle
- Individual parameters per credential type

**Current Thinking**: JSON object for flexibility and extensibility

**Decision Point**: Week 1 (Milestone 1)

---

### 4. Audit Log Storage
**Question**: Where should audit logs be stored for production deployments?

**Options**:
- File-based (simple, MVP-friendly)
- Database (PostgreSQL, better queryability)
- External logging service (Elasticsearch, Splunk)

**Current Thinking**: File-based for MVP, document integration points for external systems

**Decision Point**: Week 4 (Milestone 6)

---

### 5. User Identity
**Question**: How do we identify users in audit logs when credentials are provided programmatically?

**Options**:
- Credential hash only (minimal identity)
- Optional user identifier field in credential payload
- Integrate with OAuth/OIDC for real identity

**Current Thinking**: Optional user identifier field (client can provide email, username, etc.)

**Decision Point**: Week 4 (Milestone 6)

---

### 6. Credential Rotation
**Question**: How should credential rotation be handled for long-lived connections?

**Options**:
- Require reconnection with new credentials
- Support mid-connection credential refresh
- Automatic expiration and re-prompt

**Current Thinking**: Defer to future release, require reconnection for MVP

**Decision Point**: Post-MVP

---

### 7. Rate Limiting & Quotas
**Question**: Should we implement per-credential-set rate limiting?

**Use Case**: Prevent abuse if shared MCP server is exposed

**Current Thinking**: Defer to future release, rely on Kubernetes RBAC and AI provider rate limits for MVP

**Decision Point**: Post-MVP

```

**Client Configuration (Claude Code MCP Settings):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dot-ai": {
      "url": "https://mcp.company.com",
      "credentials": {
        "kubeconfig": "/Users/alice/.kube/config"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Result**: Alice's operations use company Anthropic key + Alice's kubeconfig

---

### Example 2: All Individual Credentials

**Server Environment Variables:**
```bash
# No credentials set
```

**Client Configuration (Claude Code MCP Settings):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dot-ai": {
      "url": "https://mcp.company.com",
      "credentials": {
        "kubeconfig": "/Users/bob/.kube/config",
        "anthropic_api_key": "sk-ant-bob-personal-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Result**: Bob's operations use Bob's Anthropic key + Bob's kubeconfig

---

### Example 3: Legacy Local Setup (No Changes)

**Server Environment Variables:**
```bash
export KUBECONFIG=/Users/charlie/.kube/config
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-charlie-key
```

**Client Configuration (Claude Code MCP Settings):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dot-ai": {
      "command": "npm",
      "args": ["run", "start:mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```
