## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
- [ ] **Risk**: Pattern quality inconsistency could mislead AI recommendations | **Mitigation**: Validation guidelines and review workflow | **Owner**: Platform Team
- [ ] **Risk**: Low organizational adoption of pattern creation | **Mitigation**: Clear value demonstration and easy workflow | **Owner**: Product Team
- [ ] **Risk**: Pattern conflicts or contradictions causing confusion | **Mitigation**: Conflict detection and resolution guidance | **Owner**: Developer
- [ ] **Risk**: Performance impact on recommendation speed | **Mitigation**: Efficient pattern search and caching | **Owner**: Developer

### Mitigation Actions
- [ ] **Pattern Guidelines**: Create clear guidelines for effective pattern creation
- [ ] **User Training**: Provide training materials and examples for pattern authors
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor pattern retrieval impact on recommendation performance
- [ ] **Quality Feedback**: Establish feedback loop for pattern effectiveness

## Decision Log

### Open Questions
- [ ] **Pattern granularity**: What level of detail should patterns capture (high-level vs specific)?
- [ ] **Pattern approval**: Should patterns require approval workflow or direct creation?
- [ ] **Pattern versioning**: How do we handle pattern updates and evolution?
- [ ] **Pattern ownership**: Who can create/modify patterns in an organization?

### Resolved Decisions
- [x] **Suggestion-based approach**: Patterns serve as suggestions to AI, not requirements - **Decided**: 2025-01-28 **Rationale**: Preserves AI autonomy while providing organizational guidance
- [x] **Vector DB storage**: Use Vector DB for pattern storage and semantic search - **Decided**: 2025-01-28 **Rationale**: Enables semantic matching with user intents
- [x] **MCP tool interface**: Use MCP framework for pattern management commands - **Decided**: 2025-01-28 **Rationale**: Consistent with existing tool architecture
- [x] **Foundation for AI Memory**: Provide infrastructure that PRD #5 can build upon - **Decided**: 2025-01-28 **Rationale**: Simpler implementation path and faster time to value
- [x] **File storage replacement strategy**: Completely replace temporary file-based storage with Vector DB, no fallback - **Decided**: 2025-01-29 **Rationale**: Keeps codebase clean, forces proper Vector DB implementation, avoids confusion between storage systems
- [x] **MCP tool naming convention**: Use camelCase verb pattern (`manageOrgData`) instead of kebab-case noun (`organizational-data`) - **Decided**: 2025-01-29 **Rationale**: Consistency with existing MCP tools (testDocs, generateManifests, etc.)
- [x] **Interactive pattern creation**: AI should ask for pattern information one-by-one, not guess or invent data - **Decided**: 2025-01-29 **Rationale**: Better UX, prevents AI from creating patterns with made-up data, follows pattern of other MCP tools
- [x] **Composable pattern design**: Use focused, single-purpose patterns rather than comprehensive ones - **Decided**: 2025-01-29 **Rationale**: Enables precise matching, avoids combinatorial explosion, maintains user control over what features they get
- [x] **Hybrid search approach**: Combine embedding-based semantic search with trigger-based keyword matching - **Decided**: 2025-01-29 **Rationale**: Leverages embedding model synonym capabilities while providing exact match fallback for domain-specific terms
- [x] **MCP-only interface approach**: Confirmed complete removal of CLI interface, focus entirely on MCP interface for AI agent integration - **Decided**: 2025-07-31 **Rationale**: CLI interface was completely removed from codebase, only MCP server exists; simplifies user experience and documentation
- [x] **System diagnostics separation**: Keep version tool diagnostics separate from pattern management documentation - **Decided**: 2025-07-31 **Rationale**: Version tool serves broader system health purposes beyond pattern management; separation improves documentation clarity and reusability
- [x] **Documentation architecture simplification**: Create single comprehensive pattern management guide instead of separate CLI reference - **Decided**: 2025-07-31 **Rationale**: With MCP-only interface, users interact through AI assistants rather than direct commands; single guide provides better user experience
- [x] **Cross-PRD consistency**: Remove all outdated CLI references across multiple PRDs to maintain documentation accuracy - **Decided**: 2025-07-31 **Rationale**: Ensures consistency across project documentation and prevents confusion about non-existent interfaces
