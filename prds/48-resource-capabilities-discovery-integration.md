# PRD-48: Resource Capabilities Discovery & Integration

**Status**: Complete ✅  
**Created**: 2025-08-05  
**Completed**: 2025-08-07  
**GitHub Issue**: [#48](https://github.com/vfarcic/dot-ai/issues/48)  
**Dependencies**: [PRD #47 - Generic Cluster Data Management Tool](./47-generic-cluster-data-management-tool.md)  
**Related PRDs**: Works alongside PRD #49 (Resource Dependencies) for complete solution

## Executive Summary

AI recommendation system fails to match user intents like "PostgreSQL database" to optimal resources like `sqls.devopstoolkit.live` because it cannot understand semantic relationships between generic resource names and specific capabilities. This PRD implements cluster scanning to discover and store resource capabilities in Vector DB, enabling semantic intent-to-resource matching that solves the "sqls.devopstoolkit.live not found" problem.

## Problem Statement

### Current Issues with Semantic Matching
1. **Generic Name Blindness**: AI doesn't recognize that "SQL" resource handles "PostgreSQL" intents
2. **Capability Unknown**: System doesn't know what each resource actually does
3. **Intent Mismatch**: "database in Azure" doesn't match `sqls.devopstoolkit.live` 
4. **Overwhelming Information**: 415 resources without capability context confuses AI

### Real-World Impact
- User requests: "PostgreSQL database on Azure"
- AI sees: `sqls.devopstoolkit.live` (name means nothing to AI)
- AI picks: Complex multi-resource solutions instead
- User misses: Perfect one-resource solution that handles everything

## Success Criteria

### Primary Goals
- **Semantic Discovery**: "PostgreSQL" intent finds `sqls.devopstoolkit.live` as top candidate
- **Capability Intelligence**: System understands what each resource actually does
- **Intent Matching**: Generic resource names matched to specific user needs
- **Improved Recommendations**: AI gets pre-filtered, relevant resource candidates

### Success Metrics
- `sqls.devopstoolkit.live` appears in PostgreSQL/database recommendations
- Composite resources prioritized over complex multi-resource solutions
- Recommendation accuracy improves for generic resource names
- AI processing time reduces (fewer resources to analyze)

## Solution Architecture

### Capability Discovery Pipeline
```
Cluster Resources (415+)
↓
Schema Analysis + Metadata Extraction
↓
Capability Inference (AI-powered)
↓
Vector DB Storage (semantic embeddings)
↓
Fast Semantic Search for Recommendations
```

### Integration with PRD #47 - Enhanced User Interface
```typescript
// Phase 1: Resource Selection
await manageClusterData({
  dataType: 'capabilities',
  operation: 'scan'
});
// → Response: "Scan all 415 resources or specify subset? (all/specific)"

// Phase 2: Processing Mode Selection  
// → Response: "Processing mode: auto (batch process) or manual (review each)?"

// Auto Mode: Batch processing
// → Processes all selected resources, shows summary

// Manual Mode: Individual validation (for testing/development)
// → Shows complete ResourceCapability data for each resource
// → "Resource 1/5: SQL.devopstoolkit.live
//    === Data to be stored in Vector DB ===
//    { kind: 'SQL', capabilities: ['postgresql', 'mysql'], ... }
//    Continue storing this capability? (yes/no/stop)"

// NEW: Interactive capability search
await manageClusterData({
  dataType: 'capabilities',
  operation: 'search',
  query: 'postgresql database',
  limit: 10,
  complexityFilter: 'low',
  providerFilter: ['azure', 'aws']
});
// → Response: Ranked list of matching capabilities with scores

// Vector DB storage with simplified ID format
const capabilityId = CapabilityInferenceEngine.generateCapabilityId(resourceName);
await this.vectorDB.store({
  id: capabilityId,
  type: 'capability',
  embedding,
  metadata: capability
});
// Examples: capability-sqls-devopstoolkit-live, capability-resourcegroups-azure-upbound-io

// Later, during recommendations (uses same search method):
const capabilityService = new CapabilityVectorService();
const capabilities = await capabilityService.searchCapabilities(userIntent, 10);
// Returns: High-quality capability matches for AI pre-filtering
```

## Technical Implementation

### Capability Data Structure
```typescript
interface ResourceCapability {
  // Resource identification (simplified)
  resourceName: string;      // "sqls.devopstoolkit.live"
  
  // Capability information
  capabilities: string[];    // ["postgresql", "mysql", "database", "multi cloud"]
  providers: string[];       // ["azure", "gcp", "aws"] 
  abstractions: string[];    // ["high availability", "persistent storage", "backup"]
  complexity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';  // User experience complexity
  
  // Metadata for AI understanding
  description: string;       // "Managed database solution supporting multiple engines"
  useCase: string;          // "Simple database deployment without infrastructure complexity"
  confidence: number;        // AI confidence score (0-100)
  
  // Analysis metadata
  analyzedAt: string;        // ISO timestamp
}
```

### Capability Inference Engine
```typescript
class CapabilityInferenceEngine {
  /**
   * Analyze resource to infer capabilities using AI-first approach
   * @param resourceName Simple string resource name (e.g., "resourcegroups.azure.upbound.io")
   * @throws Error if capability inference fails for any reason
   */
  async inferCapabilities(resourceName: string, schema?: string, metadata?: any): Promise<ResourceCapability> {
    // AI-powered inference from all available context
    const aiResult = await this.inferWithAI(resourceName, schema, metadata);
    
    // Build final capability structure
    return this.buildResourceCapability(resourceName, aiResult);
  }
  
  /**
   * Use AI to infer all capability data from resource context
   * @throws Error if AI inference fails or response is invalid
   */
  private async inferWithAI(resourceName: string, schema?: string, metadata?: any): Promise<{
    capabilities: string[];
    providers: string[];
    abstractions: string[];
    complexity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
    description: string;
    useCase: string;
    confidence: number;
  }> {
    const prompt = await this.buildInferencePrompt(resourceName, schema, metadata);
    const response = await this.claudeIntegration.sendMessage(prompt);
    return this.parseCapabilitiesFromAI(response); // Throws on parse failure
  }
  
  /**
   * Build AI inference prompt using template from prompts/capability-inference.md
   * @throws Error if prompt template cannot be loaded
   */
  private async buildInferencePrompt(resourceName: string, schema?: string, metadata?: any): Promise<string> {
    const promptPath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'prompts', 'capability-inference.md');
    const template = fs.readFileSync(promptPath, 'utf8');
    
    return template
      .replace('{resourceName}', resourceName)
      .replace('{schema}', schema || 'No schema provided')
      .replace('{metadata}', metadata ? JSON.stringify(metadata, null, 2) : 'No metadata provided');
  }
}
```

### Vector DB Integration
```typescript
class CapabilityVectorService {
  async storeCapability(capability: ResourceCapability): Promise<void> {
    // Generate embedding from capability description
    const embedding = await this.generateEmbedding(
      `${capability.resourceName} ${capability.capabilities.join(' ')} ${capability.description}`
    );
    
    const capabilityId = CapabilityInferenceEngine.generateCapabilityId(capability.resourceName);
    
    await this.vectorDB.store({
      id: capabilityId,
      type: 'capability',
      embedding,
      metadata: capability
    });
  }
  
  async searchCapabilities(intent: string, limit: number = 10): Promise<ResourceCapability[]> {
    const results = await this.vectorDB.search(intent, {
      type: 'capability',
      limit
    });
    
    return results.map(result => result.metadata as ResourceCapability);
  }
}
```

## Integration with Recommendation System

### Enhanced Two-Phase Recommendation Flow

#### Current Flow (Broken)
```
User: "PostgreSQL database"
↓
AI gets 415 raw resources
↓
AI picks: StatefulSet + ConfigMap + Secret (complex)
↓
Misses: sqls.devopstoolkit.live (perfect solution)
```

#### New Flow (With Capabilities)
```
User: "PostgreSQL database"
↓
Phase 1: Semantic capability search with rich context
  Vector DB finds: 100 capability-matched resources including:
  - sqls.devopstoolkit.live (score: 0.95, capabilities: postgresql+azure+low complexity)
  - Server.dbforpostgresql.azure (score: 0.87, capabilities: postgresql+azure+medium complexity)
  - StatefulSet (score: 0.45, capabilities: persistent storage+high complexity)
↓
Phase 2: AI ranking of pre-filtered candidates with capability context
  AI compares: 100 relevant, well-described resources instead of 415 generic names
↓
Result: sqls.devopstoolkit.live ranked #1 (optimal solution with clear reasoning)
```

### Modified AI Ranking Integration
```typescript
// Enhanced findBestSolutions in schema.ts
async findBestSolutions(
  intent: string, 
  explainResource: (resource: string) => Promise<any>
): Promise<ResourceSolution[]> {
  // NEW: Replace mass resource discovery with capability-based pre-filtering
  const capabilityService = new CapabilityVectorService();
  const relevantCapabilities = await capabilityService.searchCapabilities(intent, { limit: 100 });
  
  if (relevantCapabilities.length > 0) {
    console.log(`🎯 Found ${relevantCapabilities.length} relevant capabilities (vs 415+ mass discovery)`);
    
    // Get schemas only for capability-identified resources
    const resourceNames = relevantCapabilities.map(cap => cap.resourceName);
    
    // Fetch schemas for pre-filtered resources with rich capability context
    const schemas = await Promise.all(
      resourceNames.map(async (resourceName) => ({
        resourceName,
        schema: await explainResource(resourceName),
        capabilities: relevantCapabilities.find(cap => cap.resourceName === resourceName)
      }))
    );
    
    return await this.rankWithCapabilityContext(intent, schemas);
  }
  
  // Fail fast with clear user guidance if no capabilities available
  throw new Error(
    `No capabilities found for "${intent}". Please scan your cluster first:\n` +
    `Run: manageOrgData({ dataType: "capabilities", operation: "scan" })`
  );
}
```

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **AI Inference Accuracy**: Capability inference might be incorrect for complex resources
- **Schema Parsing Complexity**: Different CRD schemas may be inconsistent
- **Performance Impact**: Full cluster scanning could be slow for large clusters

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Validation Framework**: Human-reviewable capability inference with override capabilities
- **Incremental Analysis**: Scan resources progressively, not all at once
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache capability analysis to avoid repeated schema fetching

## Decision Log

### Design Decisions Made

#### User Interface Architecture (2025-08-05)
**Decision**: Implement MCP Tool Interface with two-phase interaction
- **Phase 1**: Resource selection (all resources vs. specific subset)
- **Phase 2**: Processing mode selection (auto vs. manual)
- **Manual Mode**: Show complete ResourceCapability data structure for validation
**Rationale**: Provides testing/development validation while maintaining usability for production
**Impact**: Affects Milestone 3 implementation and user experience design

#### Generic Capability Extraction Scope (2025-08-05)
**Decision**: Build universal capability extraction for all resource types (not database-specific)
**Rationale**: System should handle databases, applications, storage, networking, and any other CRD types
**Impact**: Requires generic extraction rules and broader testing scenarios

#### Data Structure Approach (2025-08-05)
**Decision**: AI-inferred values within predefined structure constraints
- Field names and types are fixed (`capabilities`, `providers`, `complexity`, etc.)
- AI has flexibility in value assignment within constraints
- Consider vocabulary consistency for semantic matching effectiveness
**Rationale**: Balances AI flexibility with data structure consistency
**Impact**: Affects capability inference implementation and Vector DB schema design

#### Capability Extraction Strategy (2025-08-05)
**Decision**: AI-first approach with no hardcoded domain rules
- Remove all hardcoded domain-specific detection (e.g., "Database capabilities detection")
- Use generic schema analysis to extract raw terms/patterns
- Let AI interpret patterns and generate all capability data through prompts
**Rationale**: Generic approach works for any resource type, avoids maintenance of domain-specific rules
**Impact**: Simplifies implementation, increases reliance on AI prompt quality and Claude integration

#### Error Handling Philosophy (2025-08-05)
**Decision**: Fail fast with errors rather than storing incorrect/minimal data
- Throw errors when capability inference fails (AI errors, parsing failures, etc.)
- No fallback to "minimal capability" objects with placeholder data
- Preserve Vector DB data quality by rejecting bad inferences
**Rationale**: Incorrect capability data is worse than no data - prevents misleading recommendations
**Impact**: Requires robust error handling in batch processing, may reduce successful analysis rate

#### Vector DB ID Format (2025-08-05)
**Decision**: Use standard Kubernetes nomenclature in capability IDs
- Format: `capability-{apiVersion}-{kind}` (slashes replaced with dashes)
- Examples: `capability-devopstoolkit.live-v1beta1-SQL`, `capability-apps-v1-Deployment`
- Include apiVersion to track schema evolution across resource versions
**Rationale**: Follows K8s conventions, enables tracking capability changes across schema versions
**Impact**: Affects Vector DB storage implementation and capability retrieval logic

#### Interface Simplification (2025-08-06)
**Decision**: Replace ResourceReference object parsing with direct string-based resource names
- Remove complex `kind`, `group`, `apiVersion` field parsing
- AI works directly with full resource names (e.g., "resourcegroups.azure.upbound.io")
- Eliminate unnecessary ResourceReference interface and associated parsing logic
**Rationale**: AI can understand full resource names without manual parsing, reducing complexity and potential parsing errors
**Impact**: Simplifies implementation, improves maintainability, reduces brittle parsing code, makes system more flexible for various resource naming conventions

#### Natural Language Capability Tags (2025-08-06)
**Decision**: Use natural language phrases instead of hyphenated terms in capability tags
- Store "high availability" instead of "high-availability"
- Store "managed service" instead of "managed-service" 
- Store "object storage" instead of "object-storage"
**Rationale**: Matches how users naturally think and search ("I want high availability" not "I want high-availability")
**Impact**: Improves user experience, better semantic search compatibility, more intuitive capability discovery

#### Workflow State Management (2025-08-06)
**Decision**: Clear response parameters when transitioning between workflow steps
- Prevent response data from previous step contaminating next step logic
- Explicitly pass `{ ...args, response: undefined }` during step transitions
- Maintain clean state boundaries between workflow phases
**Rationale**: Fixes critical bug where "manual" response from processing-mode step was incorrectly interpreted as capability preview response
**Impact**: Ensures workflow state integrity, prevents parameter contamination bugs, improves workflow reliability

#### Vector DB ID Format Revision (2025-08-06)
**Decision**: Simplify Vector DB ID format to use resource names directly
- Updated format: `capability-{resourceName}` with dots/slashes replaced by dashes
- Example: `capability-resourcegroups-azure-upbound-io` 
- Remove apiVersion tracking from ID format
**Rationale**: Aligns with simplified interface approach, easier to generate and debug
**Impact**: Affects Vector DB storage keys, simpler ID generation logic

#### Dual-Purpose Capability Search Architecture (2025-08-06)
**Decision**: Implement unified capability search functionality serving both user-facing and internal system needs
- **User-facing**: Add `search` operation to `manageOrgData` MCP tool for interactive capability discovery
- **Internal**: Use same `searchCapabilities()` method for recommendation system pre-filtering in `schema.ts`
- **Shared Implementation**: Single source of truth in `CapabilityVectorService.searchCapabilities()` method
- **Parameters**: Support query, limit, complexityFilter, and providerFilter for both use cases
**Rationale**: Eliminates code duplication, ensures consistent search behavior, provides user validation path for recommendation logic
**Impact**: 
- Extends Milestone 4 to include MCP search operation before recommendation integration
- Enables users to test semantic matching interactively before automated use
- Validates search functionality works correctly before internal system integration
- Provides debugging and discovery path for capability management

#### Mass Resource Discovery Elimination (2025-08-07)
**Decision**: Replace mass Kubernetes resource discovery with capability-based pre-filtering in recommendation system
- **Remove**: `discoverResources()`, `discoverCRDs()`, `getAPIResources()` functions that enumerate all 415+ cluster resources
- **Remove**: Resource discovery wrapper functions in `recommend.ts` and function parameters in `schema.ts`
- **Replace**: Mass discovery with targeted capability search: `searchCapabilities(intent, {limit: 100})` 
- **Keep**: Individual resource schema retrieval (`explainResource()`) for specific resources identified by capability search
- **No Fallback**: Fail fast with clear user guidance if no capabilities found, requiring cluster scanning first
- **Result**: ~200-300 lines of obsolete discovery code eliminated, replaced with ~5 lines of capability-based pre-filtering
**Rationale**: 
- Mass enumeration of 415+ resources overwhelms AI with irrelevant options and generic names
- Capability-based pre-filtering provides AI with semantically relevant, context-rich resource candidates
- Eliminates unnecessary Kubernetes API calls and improves recommendation performance
- Semantic search already validates which resources are relevant for user intents
- Fail-fast approach eliminates complexity of maintaining dual code paths and ensures capability adoption
- Clear error messages guide users to proper system setup instead of degraded functionality
**Impact**:
- **Code Reduction**: Significant reduction in discovery complexity and maintenance burden (~200-300 lines eliminated)
- **Performance**: Faster recommendations through reduced API calls and smaller candidate sets  
- **Accuracy**: AI receives focused, relevant candidates instead of exhaustive resource lists
- **Architecture**: Clean separation between capability discovery (Vector DB) and schema retrieval (Kubernetes API)
- **Maintainability**: Single code path to maintain, no dual fallback complexity
- **User Experience**: Clear error messages guide users to scan capabilities first, ensuring proper system setup

#### Capability-Based Resource Limit Optimization (2025-01-08)
**Decision**: Use 100-resource limit for capability-based pre-filtering instead of smaller limits (3-5 or 10-20 resources)
- **Limit**: Set `searchCapabilities(intent, {limit: 100})` as default for recommendation system integration
- **Rationale**: Enables comprehensive solution diversity while maintaining semantic relevance
- **Quality over Quantity**: 100 relevant resources with capability context superior to smaller sets without context
- **Solution Strategies**: Supports diverse approaches (single composite resources, multi-resource combinations, different complexity levels)
- **Evidence-Based**: Aligns with existing system optimization showing 100-resource limit works effectively
**Impact**:
- **Phase 1 Enhancement**: AI receives 100 capability-rich resources instead of 415 generic resource names
- **Solution Diversity**: Enables single-resource solutions, multi-resource combinations, and complexity-based alternatives
- **Context Quality**: Each resource includes capabilities, providers, complexity, use cases, and semantic relevance scores
- **Performance**: Maintains fast response times while maximizing recommendation quality

#### Rich Context Data Format for AI Integration (2025-01-08) 
**Decision**: Enhance Phase 1 data format to include comprehensive capability context for each resource
- **Context Elements**: Include capabilities, providers, abstractions, complexity, use cases, confidence scores, semantic relevance
- **Format Enhancement**: Transform generic resource lists into capability-rich resource descriptions
- **AI Decision Support**: Provide semantic context enabling informed resource selection and combination strategies
- **User Experience**: Enable AI to explain why specific resources match user intents
**Rationale**: Rich context enables superior AI decision-making compared to generic resource names
**Impact**:
- **Improved Matching**: AI can understand resource purposes and match them to user intents semantically
- **Solution Quality**: Better resource combinations based on capability compatibility and complexity appropriateness  
- **User Understanding**: AI can provide clear explanations for resource recommendations based on capability analysis

#### Comprehensive Documentation Strategy (2025-08-07)
**Decision**: Complete all user documentation as part of PRD-48 rather than treating it as follow-up work
- **Scope**: Create new capability management guide, update README, recommendation guide, setup guide, and pattern guide
- **Phased Approach**: Phase 1 (capability guide + README) for core documentation, Phase 2 (integration docs) for completeness
- **Quality Standard**: All documentation must be validated against working implementation
- **Completion Criteria**: 100% PRD completion includes comprehensive user documentation, not just implementation
**Rationale**: Documentation is essential for user adoption and production readiness - should not be deferred
**Impact**:
- **PRD Scope**: Documentation work is part of core deliverable, not optional enhancement
- **Completion Definition**: PRD reaches 100% only when users can successfully adopt the capability system
- **User Experience**: Ensures capability system is accessible to other teams and individuals
- **Production Readiness**: Complete documentation is required for production deployment

## Appendix

### Example: PostgreSQL Intent Matching Flow

#### Current State (Broken)
```
User Intent: "PostgreSQL database on Azure"
↓
AI Analysis: 415 resources → overwhelmed
↓  
AI Selection: Server.dbforpostgresql.azure + StatefulSet + ConfigMap
↓
Missing: sqls.devopstoolkit.live (because AI didn't understand it handles PostgreSQL)
```

#### After Implementation (Fixed)
```
User Intent: "PostgreSQL database on Azure"
↓
Capability Search: "postgresql database azure" (limit: 100)
↓
Vector DB Results: 100 capability-matched resources including:
  1. sqls.devopstoolkit.live (score: 0.95) - capabilities: [postgresql, database, azure, multi-cloud], complexity: low
  2. server.dbforpostgresql.azure (score: 0.87) - capabilities: [postgresql, azure, infrastructure], complexity: medium
  3. StatefulSet (score: 0.45) - capabilities: [persistent storage, stateful applications], complexity: high
  ... (97 more relevant resources with capability context)
↓
AI Ranking: Pre-filtered candidates with rich capability context enables informed decisions
↓
Final Result: sqls.devopstoolkit.live ranked #1 with clear reasoning based on capability match!
```

### Capability Inference Examples

#### SQL Resource Analysis
```yaml
# Input: sqls.devopstoolkit.live CRD
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: sqls.devopstoolkit.live
spec:
  group: devopstoolkit.live
  names:
    kind: SQL
    plural: sqls

# AI Inference Process:
# 1. Schema Analysis: "SQL" + "database" fields → database capability
# 2. Group Analysis: "devopstoolkit.live" → high-level composite  
# 3. Field Analysis: "provider", "engine" → multi-cloud, multi-engine
# 4. AI Context: "Simple database management" → low complexity

# Output: ResourceCapability
{
  resourceName: "sqls.devopstoolkit.live",
  capabilities: ["postgresql", "mysql", "database", "multi cloud"],
  providers: ["azure", "gcp", "aws"],
  abstractions: ["managed service", "high availability"],
  complexity: "low",
  description: "High-level managed database solution supporting multiple engines and cloud providers",
  useCase: "Simple database deployment without infrastructure complexity",
  confidence: 90,
  analyzedAt: "2025-08-06T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

This PRD ensures that users requesting database solutions will find the optimal high-level resources instead of being overwhelmed with complex multi-resource alternatives.
