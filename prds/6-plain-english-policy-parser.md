# PRD: Plain English Policy Parser for Enterprise Governance

**Created**: 2025-07-28
**Status**: Draft
**Owner**: Viktor Farcic
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-28

## Executive Summary
Parse organizational policies written in plain English and convert them to enforceable rules automatically, making governance accessible to non-technical stakeholders while ensuring automated compliance.

## Documentation Changes

### Files Created/Updated
- **`docs/policy-governance-guide.md`** - New File - Complete guide for policy parsing and governance features
- **`docs/mcp-guide.md`** - MCP Documentation - Add policy validation and enforcement MCP tools
- **`README.md`** - Project Overview - Add policy governance to enterprise capabilities
- **`src/core/policy/`** - Technical Implementation - Policy parsing and enforcement modules

### Content Location Map
- **Feature Overview**: See `docs/policy-governance-guide.md` (Section: "What is Policy Governance")
- **Policy Writing**: See `docs/policy-governance-guide.md` (Section: "Writing Policies in Plain English")
- **Setup Instructions**: See `docs/policy-governance-guide.md` (Section: "Configuration")
- **MCP Tools**: See `docs/mcp-guide.md` (Section: "Policy Management Tools")
- **Examples**: See `docs/policy-governance-guide.md` (Section: "Policy Examples")
- **Troubleshooting**: See `docs/policy-governance-guide.md` (Section: "Policy Violations")

### User Journey Validation
- [ ] **Primary workflow** documented end-to-end: Write policy → Parse with AI → Deploy with validation → Handle violations
- [ ] **Secondary workflows** have complete coverage: Policy management, violation resolution, compliance reporting
- [ ] **Cross-references** between deployment docs and policy docs work correctly
- [ ] **Examples and commands** are testable via automated validation

## Implementation Requirements
- [ ] **Core functionality**: Natural language policy parsing with Claude SDK - Documented in `docs/policy-governance-guide.md` (Section: "Policy Parsing Engine")
- [ ] **User workflows**: Interactive violation resolution workflows - Documented in `docs/policy-governance-guide.md` (Section: "Violation Resolution")
- [ ] **MCP Tools**: Deployment validation against parsed policies - Documented in `docs/mcp-guide.md` (Section: "Policy Management Tools")
- [ ] **Error handling**: Graceful handling of policy conflicts and parsing errors - Documented in `docs/policy-governance-guide.md` (Section: "Common Issues")
- [ ] **Performance optimization**: Sub-100ms policy validation for typical deployments

### Success Criteria
- [ ] **Parsing accuracy**: Parse 95% of common policy statements written in natural language
- [ ] **Violation clarity**: Provide clear, actionable policy violation messages with resolution guidance
- [ ] **Workflow integration**: Interactive resolution workflows for policy conflicts work seamlessly
- [ ] **Performance**: Policy validation completes in <100ms for typical deployments

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Core Policy Parsing Engine [Status: ⏳ PENDING - Blocked by PRD #38]
**Target**: Natural language policy parsing with basic enforcement working

**Dependencies**: Waiting for PRD #38 Vector Database exploration results to determine policy storage and semantic search architecture.

**Documentation Changes:**
- [ ] **`docs/policy-governance-guide.md`**: Create complete user guide with policy writing and parsing concepts
- [ ] **`docs/mcp-guide.md`**: Add policy validation and enforcement MCP tools
- [ ] **`README.md`**: Update enterprise capabilities to mention policy governance

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Design PolicyEngine class with Claude SDK integration for NLP parsing
- [ ] Implement PolicyRule interface supporting multiple policy categories (security, compliance, resources, platform)
- [ ] Create policy parsing system that converts natural language to enforceable rules
- [ ] Build basic deployment validation against parsed policies
- [ ] **Storage Architecture**: Implement policy storage based on PRD #38 Vector DB exploration results

### Phase 2: Violation Handling and Resolution [Status: ⏳ PENDING]
**Target**: Interactive policy violation workflows with resolution guidance

**Documentation Changes:**
- [ ] **`docs/policy-governance-guide.md`**: Add "Violation Resolution" section with interactive workflows
- [ ] **`docs/troubleshooting-guide.md`**: Add policy-specific troubleshooting procedures

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement comprehensive policy violation reporting with clear messages
- [ ] Create interactive violation resolution workflows
- [ ] Add policy conflict detection and resolution recommendations
- [ ] Build approval workflows for deployments requiring policy exceptions

### Phase 3: Advanced Policy Management [Status: ⏳ PENDING]
**Target**: Enterprise-grade policy management with audit and compliance features

**Documentation Changes:**
- [ ] **`docs/policy-governance-guide.md`**: Add "Advanced Features" section with audit and compliance
- [ ] **Cross-file validation**: Ensure policy governance integrates with all deployment workflows

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Add policy versioning and change management
- [ ] Implement audit logging and compliance reporting
- [ ] Create policy template system for common organizational requirements
- [ ] Build integration with external governance systems

## Work Log

### 2025-07-28: PRD Refactoring to Documentation-First Format
**Duration**: ~15 minutes
**Primary Focus**: Refactor existing PRD #6 to follow new shared-prompts/prd-create.md guidelines

**Completed Work**: 
- Updated GitHub issue #6 to follow new short, stable format
- Refactored PRD to documentation-first approach with user journey focus
- Added comprehensive documentation change mapping for policy governance features
- Structured implementation as meaningful milestones rather than micro-tasks

**Next Steps**: Ready for prd-start workflow to begin Phase 1 implementation

```
"Never deploy to production without resource limits"
"All containers must run as non-root in production"  
"Development deployments cannot exceed 2 replicas"
"Require approval for deployments costing >$100/month"
"Prefer AppClaim over standard Kubernetes when available"
