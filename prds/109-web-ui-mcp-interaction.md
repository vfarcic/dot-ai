# PRD: Web UI for MCP Server Interaction

**Issue**: [#109](https://github.com/vfarcic/dot-ai/issues/109)  
**Created**: 2025-09-17  
**Status**: Draft  
**Priority**: Medium  

---

## Executive Summary

Create a web-based user interface that acts as an MCP client, providing chat-like interactions with visual data representations. This will make the MCP server functionality accessible through a browser-based GUI, offering an alternative to CLI-based MCP clients like Claude Code.

## Problem Statement

### Current State
- MCP server provides powerful Kubernetes AI capabilities through CLI clients (Claude Code, Cursor)
- Users must use MCP-compatible editors or command-line tools to interact with the system
- No web-based interface exists for users who prefer browser-based interactions
- Visual data representation is limited in text-based CLI environments

### Pain Points
- **Accessibility Barrier**: Users unfamiliar with CLI tools or MCP clients can't easily access the system
- **Limited Visualization**: Complex Kubernetes data and AI recommendations are hard to visualize in text-only interfaces  
- **User Experience Gap**: No graphical interface for exploring cluster capabilities, solutions, and deployments
- **Sharing & Collaboration**: Difficult to share visual insights or collaborate on deployment decisions

## Success Criteria

### User Experience Success
- [ ] Users can interact with all MCP functionality through a web browser
- [ ] Chat interface provides intuitive conversation flow similar to Claude Code
- [ ] Complex data (cluster capabilities, recommendations, manifests) displays with visual representations
- [ ] Response time for MCP tool calls under 3 seconds for standard operations

### Technical Success  
- [ ] Web UI successfully connects to and communicates with existing MCP server
- [ ] All current MCP tools accessible through the web interface
- [ ] Visual components render Kubernetes resources, deployment statuses, and AI recommendations
- [ ] System handles concurrent users without performance degradation

### Business Success
- [ ] Increased MCP adoption due to improved accessibility
- [ ] Positive user feedback on visual data representation
- [ ] Documentation demonstrates clear setup and usage workflows

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **DevOps Engineers**: Need visual overview of cluster capabilities and deployment status
- **Platform Engineers**: Want graphical interface for managing AI recommendations and solutions  
- **Developers**: Prefer browser-based tools over CLI for exploring Kubernetes deployment options

### Secondary Users
- **Engineering Managers**: Need visual dashboards for understanding deployment patterns and cluster usage
- **Site Reliability Engineers**: Want graphical monitoring of AI-assisted deployment outcomes

## User Stories & Workflows

### Core User Journey
```
User opens Web UI → Authenticated session → Chat interface loads → 
User types intent ("deploy web app") → MCP processes request → 
Visual solution cards displayed → User configures through forms → 
Deployment manifests shown with syntax highlighting → 
Deploy button triggers MCP deployment → Status updates shown graphically
```

### Detailed User Stories

**As a DevOps Engineer**, I want to:
- See cluster capabilities as interactive cards/charts rather than text lists
- Configure deployment solutions through visual forms instead of typing answers
- View generated Kubernetes manifests with syntax highlighting and collapsible sections
- Monitor deployment progress through visual status indicators

**As a Platform Engineer**, I want to:
- Browse solution patterns through a visual catalog interface
- Create and manage organizational patterns using drag-and-drop or form interfaces  
- Visualize resource dependencies as interactive graphs
- Share deployment configurations via shareable URLs

**As a Developer**, I want to:
- Chat with the AI in a familiar interface similar to ChatGPT/Claude
- See deployment recommendations as comparison tables or decision trees
- Preview how my application will look in the cluster before deploying
- Get visual feedback on deployment success/failure with actionable next steps

## Technical Architecture

### High-Level Architecture
```
[Web Browser] ↔ [Frontend (React/Vue/Angular)] ↔ [MCP Protocol] ↔ [Existing MCP Server] ↔ [Kubernetes API]
```

### Component Breakdown

**Frontend Application (New Repository)**
- **Chat Interface**: Message threads, typing indicators, message history
- **Visual Components**: Charts, graphs, forms, syntax highlighting, status dashboards
- **MCP Client**: WebSocket/HTTP connection to MCP server, protocol handling
- **State Management**: User sessions, conversation history, deployment tracking

**Backend Integration**
- **MCP Server**: Existing server with no modifications required
- **Authentication**: Session management for web users (if needed)
- **WebSocket Gateway**: Real-time communication layer (may be part of frontend)

### Technology Stack Recommendations
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js or Vue.js/Nuxt.js for rich UI components
- **MCP Communication**: WebSocket client for real-time chat experience
- **Visualization**: D3.js, Chart.js, or similar for data visualization
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS or Material-UI for consistent design
- **State Management**: Redux/Zustand or Vuex for complex state handling
