# PRD: OpenTelemetry Tracing for MCP Server

**Created**: 2025-10-03
**Status**: Draft
**Owner**: Viktor Farcic
**GitHub Issue**: [#137](https://github.com/vfarcic/dot-ai/issues/137)
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-03

## Executive Summary
Add OpenTelemetry distributed tracing to the MCP server to provide vendor-neutral observability for debugging complex multi-step workflows, measuring AI provider performance, and understanding Kubernetes operation latency. This enables production-ready monitoring without infrastructure lock-in.

## Problem Statement

The DevOps AI Toolkit MCP server handles complex operations including:
- Multi-step workflows (buildPlatform: list → submitAnswers → execute)
- AI provider calls (Claude, OpenAI) with variable latency
- Kubernetes cluster operations (discovery, deployment, remediation)
- Session-based stateful interactions across tool calls
- HTTP/SSE and STDIO transport protocols

**Current Gap**: No distributed tracing capability to understand:
- Where time is spent in multi-tool workflows
- Which AI provider calls are slow or failing
- How Kubernetes API latency impacts user experience
- How errors correlate across complex request chains

**Impact**: Difficult to debug performance issues, optimize AI costs, and troubleshoot production incidents.

- [ ] **Cross-references** between development docs and observability docs work correctly

## Solution Overview

**Standard Server-Side OpenTelemetry Implementation**

Implement OpenTelemetry instrumentation following industry best practices:
1. **Auto-instrumentation**: HTTP, Express middleware tracing
2. **Manual instrumentation**: Tool execution, AI calls, Kubernetes operations
3. **Direct export**: Server exports traces to OTel collector (not through MCP protocol)
4. **Trace context propagation**: Correlate multi-step workflows and sessions
5. **Integration**: Extend existing Logger interface for trace context

**NOT implementing**: The controversial "send traces through MCP" approach from modelcontextprotocol/discussions/269.

## Implementation Requirements
