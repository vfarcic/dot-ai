# PRD: Recursive Documentation Testing System

**Created**: 2025-07-22
**Status**: Draft
**Owner**: Viktor Farcic
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-22

## Executive Summary
AI-powered recursive documentation validation system that follows links and relationships between documents to test entire documentation ecosystems, ensuring comprehensive accuracy across connected documentation rather than isolated document validation.

## Problem Statement
Current documentation testing (PRD 12) validates individual documents effectively but has a critical gap:
- Documentation ecosystems are interconnected through links and cross-references
- Users follow documentation paths that span multiple documents
- Broken links or outdated cross-references create poor user experience
- Documentation accuracy requires validation of the entire ecosystem, not just individual files
- Manual ecosystem testing is impractical for large documentation sets

This leads to documentation systems where individual documents work correctly but the connected user journey is broken.

## Proposed Solution
Comprehensive recursive testing system that:
- Automatically discovers documentation links and relationships
- Follows links to test connected documents using existing testing capabilities
- Validates cross-document consistency and accuracy
- Provides ecosystem-level reporting on documentation health
- Supports configurable scope controls for safety and performance
- Integrates with existing single-document testing infrastructure

## User Stories & Use Cases
- As a **documentation maintainer**, I want to validate entire documentation ecosystems so that users have consistent, working experiences across all connected documents
- As a **development team member**, I want to ensure that code changes don't break documentation relationships so that user onboarding remains smooth
- As a **technical writer**, I want to understand ecosystem health so that I can prioritize fixes that impact user journeys most
- As a **open source maintainer**, I want confidence that my entire documentation system works together so that contributors have reliable guidance
- As a **product manager**, I want ecosystem-level documentation metrics so that I can track comprehensive user experience quality

## Decision Log

### Open Questions

- [ ] **External Link Handling**: How aggressively should we test external documentation links? | **Target**: Phase 2 planning
- [ ] **Performance vs Coverage**: What's the right balance between comprehensive coverage and reasonable performance? | **Target**: Phase 1 implementation

### Resolved Decisions
- [x] **Separate PRD from Single-Document Testing** - **Decided**: 2025-07-22 **Rationale**: Recursive ecosystem testing is substantial functionality requiring dedicated tracking and planning separate from individual document validation
- [x] **Build on Existing Infrastructure** - **Decided**: 2025-07-22 **Rationale**: Leverage proven PRD 12 architecture and capabilities rather than rebuilding validation systems
