# PRD: Add HTTP Transport Support for Kubernetes Deployment

**Issue**: [#89](https://github.com/vfarcic/dot-ai/issues/89)  
**Author**: Viktor Farcic  
**Created**: 2025-09-05  
**Status**: Planning  
**Priority**: High

## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
The DevOps AI Toolkit MCP server currently only supports STDIO (Standard Input/Output) transport, which requires clients to spawn the server as a local subprocess. This architecture prevents:
- Deployment in Kubernetes clusters
- Remote access to the MCP server
- Scalable cloud-native architectures
- Team collaboration through shared MCP instances

### Proposed Solution
Implement dual transport support allowing the MCP server to operate in both STDIO mode (for backward compatibility) and HTTP/SSE mode (for network accessibility). The transport mechanism will be configurable via environment variable, enabling the same codebase to support both local development and Kubernetes deployment scenarios.

### Success Criteria
- MCP server can run in Kubernetes with HTTP transport
- Existing STDIO functionality remains unchanged
- Cursor and other HTTP-compatible clients can connect remotely
- Claude Desktop continues to work with STDIO transport
- Zero breaking changes for existing users
- Support both traditional Kubernetes deployment and ToolHive operator deployment

## User Journey

### Current State (STDIO Only)
1. User installs MCP server locally via npm
2. Configures Claude Desktop/Cursor with local path
3. Client spawns MCP server as subprocess
4. Communication via STDIO pipes
5. Limited to single-user, local-machine usage

### Future State (Dual Transport)
**Local Development (unchanged)**:
1. User installs MCP server locally
2. Configures client with local path
3. Server starts in STDIO mode by default
4. Works exactly as before

**Kubernetes Deployment - Traditional (new)**:
1. DevOps team deploys MCP server using Helm chart
2. Chart creates Deployment, Service, Ingress resources
3. Server starts with `TRANSPORT_TYPE=http`
4. Multiple team members connect via Cursor
5. Full control over Kubernetes resources

**Kubernetes Deployment - ToolHive (new)**:
1. DevOps team installs ToolHive operator
2. Creates MCPServer custom resource
3. ToolHive manages pods, RBAC, and security
4. Automatic proxy handling for STDIO/HTTP transports
5. Enterprise-grade security and multi-tenancy

## Technical Architecture

### Transport Layer Design
```typescript
// Pseudo-code for transport selection
const transport = process.env.TRANSPORT_TYPE === 'http' 
  ? new HttpServerTransport({
      port: process.env.PORT || 8080,
      host: process.env.HOST || '0.0.0.0'
    })
  : new StdioServerTransport();

await mcpServer.connect(transport);
```

### Configuration Matrix

| Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| `TRANSPORT_TYPE` | `stdio` | Transport mechanism (`stdio` or `http`) |
| `PORT` | `8080` | HTTP server port (HTTP mode only) |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | HTTP server host (HTTP mode only) |
| `SESSION_MODE` | `stateful` | Session handling (`stateful` or `stateless`) |

### Client Compatibility

| Client | STDIO | HTTP/SSE | Notes |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|
| Claude Desktop | ✅ | ❌ | STDIO only per current limitations |
| Cursor | ✅ | ✅ | Supports all transport types |
| Claude.ai (web) | ❌ | ✅ | Remote servers only |
| Custom Clients | ✅ | ✅ | Via MCP SDK |

## Kubernetes Deployment Architecture

### Deployment Strategy Comparison

| Aspect | Traditional Kubernetes | ToolHive Operator |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Complexity** | Medium - Standard K8s knowledge | Low - Simplified via CRD |
| **Control** | Full - Direct resource management | Managed - Operator handles details |
| **Security** | Manual - Configure RBAC/NetworkPolicies | Automatic - Built-in security defaults |
| **Multi-tenancy** | Manual configuration | Built-in support |
| **Customization** | Unlimited | Via podTemplateSpec |
| **Learning Curve** | Standard K8s | K8s + ToolHive CRDs |
| **Best For** | Teams wanting full control | Enterprise/multi-team environments |

### Deployment Option 1: Traditional Kubernetes

Users deploy using standard Kubernetes resources via Helm:

```bash
helm repo add dot-ai https://vfarcic.github.io/dot-ai
helm install my-mcp dot-ai/mcp-server \
  --set deployment.method=standard \
  --set transport.type=http \
  --set anthropic.apiKey=$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY \
  --set ingress.enabled=true \
  --set ingress.host=mcp.example.com
```

#### Resources Created (Traditional)
1. **Deployment** (`deployment.yaml`)
   - Configurable replicas (default: 3)
   - Resource limits/requests
   - Health/liveness probes
   - Graceful shutdown handling

2. **Service** (`service.yaml`)
   - ClusterIP service for internal access
   - Session affinity for stateful mode
   - Port 8080 → 8080

3. **ConfigMap** (`configmap.yaml`)
   - Transport configuration
   - Session settings
   - Logging levels

4. **Secret** (`secret.yaml`)
   - API keys (Anthropic, OpenAI)
   - Session encryption keys

5. **ServiceAccount** (`serviceaccount.yaml`)
   - RBAC for cluster operations
   - Minimal required permissions

6. **Ingress** (`ingress.yaml`) - Optional
   - NGINX annotations for WebSocket/SSE
   - TLS termination
   - Path-based routing

### Deployment Option 2: ToolHive Operator

Users first install the ToolHive operator, then deploy MCP server:

```bash
# Install ToolHive operator
helm upgrade -i toolhive-operator-crds \
  oci://ghcr.io/stacklok/toolhive/toolhive-operator-crds

helm upgrade -i toolhive-operator \
  oci://ghcr.io/stacklok/toolhive/toolhive-operator

# Deploy MCP server using our Helm chart in ToolHive mode
helm install my-mcp dot-ai/mcp-server \
  --set deployment.method=toolhive \
  --set transport.type=http \
  --set anthropic.apiKey=$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

#### MCPServer Custom Resource
```yaml
apiVersion: toolhive.stacklok.io/v1alpha1
kind: MCPServer
metadata:
  name: dot-ai-mcp
spec:
  server:
    image: ghcr.io/vfarcic/dot-ai:latest
    transport: http  # or stdio with proxy
  env:
    - name: TRANSPORT_TYPE
      value: "http"
    - name: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: mcp-secrets
          key: anthropic-api-key
  podTemplateSpec:
    spec:
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 256Mi
        limits:
          cpu: 1000m
          memory: 1Gi
```

#### ToolHive Benefits
- **Automatic RBAC**: Creates ServiceAccount and Role automatically
- **Security by default**: Runs in locked-down containers
- **Proxy management**: Handles STDIO-to-HTTP translation if needed
- **StatefulSet**: Manages stateful MCP servers properly
- **Multi-tenancy**: Built-in isolation between different MCP servers

## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Transport Selection Mechanism
**Options Considered**:
1. Command-line flag
2. Environment variable ✅
3. Configuration file

**Decision**: Environment variable
**Rationale**: Best for containerized environments, follows 12-factor app principles

### Decision 2: Deployment Method Support
**Options Considered**:
1. Traditional Kubernetes only
2. ToolHive only
3. Support both methods ✅

**Decision**: Support both with single Helm chart
**Rationale**: Different teams have different needs; flexibility maximizes adoption

### Decision 3: Default Deployment Method
**Options Considered**:
1. Traditional as default ✅
2. ToolHive as default

**Decision**: Traditional as default
**Rationale**: Lower barrier to entry, no additional operator required

## Risk Assessment

### Risk 1: Complexity of Dual Deployment Support
**Mitigation**: 
- Clear documentation for each path
- Sensible defaults
- Example values files for common scenarios

### Risk 2: ToolHive Operator Dependency
**Mitigation**:
- Traditional deployment works without ToolHive
- Clear documentation of prerequisites
- Version compatibility matrix

### Risk 3: Maintenance Burden
**Mitigation**:
- Shared templates where possible
- Automated testing for both paths
- Clear separation of concerns

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` - Must support HTTP transport
- Kubernetes cluster (1.19+)
- Helm 3.x
- ToolHive operator (optional, for ToolHive deployment)
- Redis (optional, for session storage)

### Internal Dependencies
- No breaking changes to existing tools
- Maintain current error handling patterns
- Preserve existing logging structure

## Success Metrics

1. **Adoption**: 10+ deployments in first month
2. **Method Split**: Both deployment methods used
3. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime
4. **Performance**: <100ms response time
5. **Documentation**: <30 minutes to deployment
6. **Support Burden**: <5 issues per method per month

## Open Questions

1. Should ToolHive be the recommended method for production?
2. How do we handle upgrades between deployment methods?
3. Should we provide a migration tool between methods?
4. What's the support policy for each deployment method?
5. Should we contribute back to ToolHive for better integration?
6. Do we need separate Docker images for each deployment method?
