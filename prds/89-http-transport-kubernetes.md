# PRD: Add HTTP Transport Support for Kubernetes Deployment

**Issue**: [#89](https://github.com/vfarcic/dot-ai/issues/89)  
**Author**: Viktor Farcic  
**Created**: 2025-09-05  
**Status**: Implementation  
**Priority**: High

## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
The DevOps AI Toolkit MCP server currently only supports STDIO (Standard Input/Output) transport, which requires clients to spawn the server as a local subprocess. This architecture prevents:
- Deployment in Kubernetes clusters
- Remote access to the MCP server
- Scalable cloud-native architectures
- Team collaboration through shared MCP instances

### Proposed Solution
Implement dual transport support allowing the MCP server to operate in both STDIO mode (for backward compatibility) and HTTP/SSE mode (for network accessibility). The transport mechanism will be configurable via environment variable, enabling the same codebase to support both local development and Kubernetes deployment scenarios.

### Success Criteria
- MCP server can run in Kubernetes with HTTP transport
- Existing STDIO functionality remains unchanged
- Cursor and other HTTP-compatible clients can connect remotely
- Claude Desktop continues to work with STDIO transport
- Zero breaking changes for existing users
- Support both traditional Kubernetes deployment and ToolHive operator deployment

## User Journey

### Current State (STDIO Only)
1. User installs MCP server locally via npm
2. Configures Claude Desktop/Cursor with local path
3. Client spawns MCP server as subprocess
4. Communication via STDIO pipes
5. Limited to single-user, local-machine usage

### Future State (Dual Transport)
**Local Development (unchanged)**:
1. User installs MCP server locally
2. Configures client with local path
3. Server starts in STDIO mode by default
4. Works exactly as before

**Kubernetes Deployment - Traditional (new)**:
1. DevOps team deploys MCP server using Helm chart
2. Chart creates Deployment, Service, Ingress resources
3. Server starts with `TRANSPORT_TYPE=http`
4. Multiple team members connect via Cursor
5. Full control over Kubernetes resources

**Kubernetes Deployment - ToolHive (new)**:
1. DevOps team installs ToolHive operator
2. Creates MCPServer custom resource
3. ToolHive manages pods, RBAC, and security
4. Automatic proxy handling for STDIO/HTTP transports
5. Enterprise-grade security and multi-tenancy

## Technical Architecture

### Transport Layer Design
```typescript
// Pseudo-code for transport selection
const transport = process.env.TRANSPORT_TYPE === 'http' 
  ? new HttpServerTransport({
      port: process.env.PORT || 8080,
      host: process.env.HOST || '0.0.0.0'
    })
  : new StdioServerTransport();

await mcpServer.connect(transport);
```

### Configuration Matrix

| Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| `TRANSPORT_TYPE` | `stdio` | Transport mechanism (`stdio` or `http`) |
| `PORT` | `8080` | HTTP server port (HTTP mode only) |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | HTTP server host (HTTP mode only) |
| `SESSION_MODE` | `stateful` | Session handling (`stateful` or `stateless`) |

### Client Compatibility

| Client | STDIO | HTTP/SSE | Notes |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|
| Claude Desktop | ✅ | ❌ | STDIO only per current limitations |
| Cursor | ✅ | ✅ | Supports all transport types |
| Claude.ai (web) | ❌ | ✅ | Remote servers only |
| Custom Clients | ✅ | ✅ | Via MCP SDK |

## Kubernetes Deployment Architecture

### Deployment Strategy Comparison

| Aspect | Traditional Kubernetes | ToolHive Operator |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Complexity** | Medium - Standard K8s knowledge | Low - Simplified via CRD |
| **Control** | Full - Direct resource management | Managed - Operator handles details |
| **Security** | Manual - Configure RBAC/NetworkPolicies | Automatic - Built-in security defaults |
| **Multi-tenancy** | Manual configuration | Built-in support |
| **Customization** | Unlimited | Via podTemplateSpec |
| **Learning Curve** | Standard K8s | K8s + ToolHive CRDs |
| **Best For** | Teams wanting full control | Enterprise/multi-team environments |

### Deployment Option 1: Traditional Kubernetes

Users deploy using standard Kubernetes resources via Helm:

```bash
helm repo add dot-ai https://vfarcic.github.io/dot-ai
helm install my-mcp dot-ai/mcp-server \
  --set deployment.method=standard \
  --set transport.type=http \
  --set anthropic.apiKey=$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY \
  --set ingress.enabled=true \
  --set ingress.host=mcp.example.com
```

#### Resources Created (Traditional)
1. **Deployment** (`deployment.yaml`)
   - Configurable replicas (default: 3)
   - Resource limits/requests
   - Health/liveness probes
   - Graceful shutdown handling

2. **Service** (`service.yaml`)
   - ClusterIP service for internal access
   - Session affinity for stateful mode
   - Port 8080 → 8080

3. **ConfigMap** (`configmap.yaml`)
   - Transport configuration
   - Session settings
   - Logging levels

4. **Secret** (`secret.yaml`)
   - API keys (Anthropic, OpenAI)
   - Session encryption keys

5. **ServiceAccount** (`serviceaccount.yaml`)
   - RBAC for cluster operations
   - Minimal required permissions

6. **Ingress** (`ingress.yaml`) - Optional
   - NGINX annotations for WebSocket/SSE
   - TLS termination
   - Path-based routing

### Deployment Option 2: ToolHive Operator

Users first install the ToolHive operator, then deploy MCP server:

```bash
# Install ToolHive operator
helm upgrade -i toolhive-operator-crds \
  oci://ghcr.io/stacklok/toolhive/toolhive-operator-crds

helm upgrade -i toolhive-operator \
  oci://ghcr.io/stacklok/toolhive/toolhive-operator

# Deploy MCP server using our Helm chart in ToolHive mode
helm install my-mcp dot-ai/mcp-server \
  --set deployment.method=toolhive \
  --set transport.type=http \
  --set anthropic.apiKey=$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

#### MCPServer Custom Resource
```yaml
apiVersion: toolhive.stacklok.io/v1alpha1
kind: MCPServer
metadata:
  name: dot-ai-mcp
spec:
  server:
    image: ghcr.io/vfarcic/dot-ai:latest
    transport: http  # or stdio with proxy
  env:
    - name: TRANSPORT_TYPE
      value: "http"
    - name: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: mcp-secrets
          key: anthropic-api-key
  podTemplateSpec:
    spec:
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 256Mi
        limits:
          cpu: 1000m
          memory: 1Gi
```

#### ToolHive Benefits
- **Automatic RBAC**: Creates ServiceAccount and Role automatically
- **Security by default**: Runs in locked-down containers
- **Proxy management**: Handles STDIO-to-HTTP translation if needed
- **StatefulSet**: Manages stateful MCP servers properly
- **Multi-tenancy**: Built-in isolation between different MCP servers

## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Transport Selection Mechanism
**Options Considered**:
1. Command-line flag
2. Environment variable ✅
3. Configuration file

**Decision**: Environment variable
**Rationale**: Best for containerized environments, follows 12-factor app principles

### Decision 2: Deployment Method Support
**Options Considered**:
1. Traditional Kubernetes only
2. ToolHive only
3. Support both methods ✅

**Decision**: Support both with single Helm chart
**Rationale**: Different teams have different needs; flexibility maximizes adoption

### Decision 3: Default Deployment Method
**Options Considered**:
1. Traditional as default ✅
2. ToolHive as default

**Decision**: Traditional as default
**Rationale**: Lower barrier to entry, no additional operator required

### Decision 4: CI/CD Workflow Architecture
**Decision Date**: 2025-09-09  
**Options Considered**:
1. Multiple sequential jobs (publish → docker → helm-chart → release)
2. Consolidated atomic release job ✅
3. Parallel publishing with coordination

**Decision**: Consolidated atomic release job
**Rationale**: 
- Eliminates code duplication (checkout, git setup, version updates)
- Ensures true atomicity - all artifacts published together or none at all
- Simplifies maintenance and reduces CI complexity
- Prevents race conditions between version updates

**Impact**: Milestone 5 expanded to include full CI/CD automation with coordinated publishing

### Decision 5: Version Synchronization Strategy
**Decision Date**: 2025-09-09  
**Options Considered**:
1. Manual version management across package.json, Chart.yaml, values.yaml
2. Automated synchronization from package.json as single source of truth ✅
3. Independent versioning for each artifact

**Decision**: Automated synchronization from package.json
**Rationale**:
- Single source of truth prevents version drift
- CI pipeline automatically updates Chart.yaml appVersion and values.yaml image.tag
- Users get coordinated releases with matching versions across all artifacts

**Impact**: Chart deployment guaranteed to reference correct Docker image version

### Decision 6: Testing Strategy
**Decision Date**: 2025-09-09  
**Options Considered**:
1. Test each milestone incrementally with local artifacts
2. Complete all development, then test with published artifacts ✅
3. Mix of local testing and published artifact validation

**Decision**: Complete development first, then comprehensive testing with published artifacts
**Rationale**:
- Avoids testing fragmented implementations
- Validates actual user experience with published Docker images and Helm charts
- Ensures CI/CD pipeline works end-to-end before considering complete

**Impact**: Added final integration testing milestone after all development complete

### Decision 8: Documentation Strategy
**Decision Date**: 2025-09-09  
**Options Considered**:
1. Create documentation in isolation before testing
2. Combine documentation creation with final integration testing ✅
3. Create documentation after testing is complete

**Decision**: Combined documentation + testing approach
**Rationale**:
- Documentation uses real validated commands and outputs instead of theoretical examples
- Troubleshooting sections document actual issues encountered, not hypothetical ones
- More efficient use of time - validates functionality while creating docs
- Better user experience with battle-tested examples and procedures
- Ensures documentation accuracy through real deployment validation

**Impact**: 
- Merges Milestones 7 and 8 into single combined effort
- Documentation becomes outcome of testing rather than prerequisite
- All examples, commands, and troubleshooting based on real deployment experience

### Decision 7: Session Management Architecture for Kubernetes
**Decision Date**: 2025-09-09  
**Options Considered**:
1. Support both stateful and stateless session modes in Kubernetes ❌
2. Force stateless mode for all Kubernetes deployments ✅
3. Implement session affinity and persistent session storage for stateful mode ❌

**Decision**: Force stateless mode for all Kubernetes deployments
**Rationale**:
- **Kubernetes-Native Design**: Stateless services scale better and align with cloud-native principles
- **Load Balancer Compatibility**: Works with any ingress controller without session affinity configuration
- **High Availability**: Multiple replicas possible without session complexity or single points of failure
- **Restart Resilience**: Pod failures don't lose session state, improving system reliability
- **Implementation Complexity**: Stateful mode would require session affinity configuration, persistent storage, or shared session stores (Redis)

**Technical Analysis**:
- Stateful mode (`SESSION_MODE=stateful`) generates unique session IDs and maintains per-client state
- Kubernetes load balancing without session affinity routes requests randomly across pods
- In-memory session storage in stateful mode incompatible with multi-replica deployments
- ToolHive proxy layer adds additional routing complexity that breaks stateful session assumptions

**Implementation Impact**:
- Both deployment methods hard-code `SESSION_MODE=stateless` in environment variables
- Standard deployment: Line 35 in `charts/templates/deployment.yaml`
- ToolHive deployment: Line 63 in `charts/templates/mcpserver.yaml`
- Kubernetes Service resources do not include `sessionAffinity: ClientIP` configuration
- Multi-replica scaling supported without session routing concerns

**Code Impact**:
- Session management logic in `src/interfaces/mcp.ts` lines 361-372 supports both modes
- MCP SDK `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` configured with `sessionIdGenerator: undefined` for stateless operation
- No session persistence, cleanup, or recovery mechanisms needed in Kubernetes deployments

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Eliminates session affinity routing failures and session loss during pod restarts
- Removes dependency on persistent session storage or external session stores
- Prevents "Server already initialized" errors that occur with stateful mode in multi-client scenarios

## Risk Assessment

### Risk 1: Complexity of Dual Deployment Support
**Mitigation**: 
- Clear documentation for each path
- Sensible defaults
- Example values files for common scenarios

### Risk 2: ToolHive Operator Dependency
**Mitigation**:
- Traditional deployment works without ToolHive
- Clear documentation of prerequisites
- Version compatibility matrix

### Risk 3: Maintenance Burden
**Mitigation**:
- Shared templates where possible
- Automated testing for both paths
- Clear separation of concerns

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` - Must support HTTP transport
- Kubernetes cluster (1.19+)
- Helm 3.x
- ToolHive operator (optional, for ToolHive deployment)

### Internal Dependencies
- No breaking changes to existing tools
- Maintain current error handling patterns
- Preserve existing logging structure

## Success Metrics

1. **Adoption**: 10+ deployments in first month
2. **Method Split**: Both deployment methods used
3. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime
4. **Performance**: <100ms response time
5. **Documentation**: <30 minutes to deployment
6. **Support Burden**: <5 issues per method per month

## Open Questions

1. Should ToolHive be the recommended method for production?
2. How do we handle upgrades between deployment methods?
3. Should we provide a migration tool between methods?
4. What's the support policy for each deployment method?
5. Should we contribute back to ToolHive for better integration?
6. Do we need separate Docker images for each deployment method?

---

### 2025-09-09
**Duration**: ~4 hours
**Primary Focus**: Milestone 3 Validation and Comprehensive System Testing

**Completed PRD Items**:
- [x] **Milestone 3 Validation**: ✅ Successful deployment to test Kubernetes cluster
  - Evidence: Pod `dot-ai-6798fc86f6-tr49h` running successfully in dot-ai namespace
  - HTTP transport accessible on port 3456 with proper in-cluster authentication
  - All system components reporting "healthy" status
- [x] **Milestone 6 Partial**: End-to-end client testing with MCP tools functional
  - Evidence: Version tool and capabilities scanning working via MCP client connection
  - All MCP protocol operations successful over HTTP transport

**Critical Issues Resolved**:
- **In-cluster Authentication Fixed**: Kubernetes client now properly uses ServiceAccount instead of trying to access `~/.kube/config`
  - Root cause: `resolveKubeconfigPath()` was defaulting to `~/.kube/config` even when `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST` was set
  - Solution: Modified logic to return empty string for in-cluster config, updated `executeKubectl` to omit `--kubeconfig` flag when empty
- **Kyverno Detection Fully Operational**: Policy generation now working correctly
  - Root cause: Detection logic looking for deployment named "kyverno" but actual deployments named "kyverno-admission-controller", etc.
  - Solution: Changed to filter deployments starting with "kyverno-" and verify all are ready
  - Result: Kyverno v1.15.1 detected with `policyGenerationReady: true`
- **Shared Client Architecture Implemented**: Unified KubernetesDiscovery usage across all tools
  - Refactored version tool from `executeKubectl` CLI calls to shared `KubernetesDiscovery` client
  - Ensures consistent authentication and connection handling

**System Health Validation**:
- ✅ **Kubernetes**: Connected with in-cluster authentication (ServiceAccount)
- ✅ **Vector DB**: Connected to Qdrant at `http://qdrant.dot-ai.svc.cluster.local:6333`
- ✅ **Anthropic**: Connected with API key configured
- ✅ **OpenAI**: Connected with embedding service operational (1536 dimensions)
- ✅ **Kyverno**: Full policy generation ready (all deployments and webhooks operational)
- ✅ **Capabilities System**: Fully functional with resource discovery and AI analysis

**Capabilities Scanning Verification**:
- Successfully scanned Pod resources with detailed capability analysis
- Kubernetes API access working correctly with proper RBAC permissions
- Vector DB integration storing and retrieving capability data
- AI analysis generating accurate capability descriptions and confidence scores

**Technical Architecture Validated**:
- HTTP transport serving on port 3456 with proper CORS support
- Environment variables correctly controlling transport selection
- In-cluster configuration working without external kubeconfig files
- All MCP protocol operations functional over HTTP/SSE transport
- Image versioning through 0.83.0-test.10 with incremental fixes

**Testing Evidence**:
- 29/29 version tool tests passing after refactoring to shared client
- Multiple successful MCP client connections and tool invocations
- Resource discovery working across 349+ cluster resources
- System status reporting "overall: healthy" with all capabilities enabled

**Next Session Priorities**:
1. Begin Milestone 5: Unified Helm chart development (template existing manifests)
2. Create Kustomize overlays for dev/staging/prod environments  
3. Implement health check endpoints for production readiness
4. Begin Milestone 4: ToolHive integration using Helm chart

- **Chart Structure**: Created complete Helm chart in `charts/` directory with proper Chart.yaml and dependencies
- **Template Conversion**: Converted all existing manifests to proper Helm templates:
  - `deployment.yaml` with configurable image, resources, secrets, and Qdrant URL
  - `service.yaml` with helper functions for names and labels
  - `secret.yaml` with conditional creation based on provided API keys
  - `ingress.yaml` with nginx annotations for SSE support and TLS configuration
  - `serviceaccount.yaml` with conditional creation
  - `clusterrole.yaml` and `clusterrolebinding.yaml` with proper RBAC templating
- **Helper Functions**: Created comprehensive `_helpers.tpl` with standard Helm template functions
- **Values Configuration**: Designed minimal, well-commented `values.yaml` with:
  - Image configuration (repository, tag)
  - Resource limits/requests
  - Secret management (conditional creation)
  - ServiceAccount settings
  - Ingress configuration with required nginx annotations
  - Qdrant dependency management (internal vs external)

**Key Technical Achievements**:
- **Dual Deployment Support**: Chart supports both internal Qdrant (via dependency) and external Qdrant (via URL)
- **Configuration Validation**: Successfully tested various deployment scenarios:
  - Standard deployment: `helm template` with internal Qdrant
  - External Qdrant: `qdrant.enabled=false` with `qdrant.external.url`
  - Ingress enabled: Proper nginx annotations for HTTP transport with SSE
  - API key management: Secrets created conditionally when keys provided
- **Production Deployment**: Successfully deployed to Kubernetes cluster and validated full functionality
- **MCP Integration**: Confirmed HTTP transport working via ingress with proper SSE support
- **Dependency Management**: Qdrant chart integration working with customizable image overrides

**Technical Discoveries and Solutions**:
- **Qdrant Persistence Issue**: Discovered Qdrant chart always uses persistence, making demo images with pre-built data ineffective
- **Configuration Override Testing**: Validated that `qdrant.enabled=false` properly excludes Qdrant resources
- **Values.yaml Cleanup**: Removed non-functional `qdrant.persistence.enabled` setting that had no effect
- **Ingress Annotations**: Implemented required nginx annotations for HTTP transport with long-running SSE connections

**Testing and Validation**:
- **Template Rendering**: All templates render correctly with various configuration combinations
- **Deployment Testing**: Chart deploys successfully to Kubernetes with proper resource creation
- **Functional Testing**: Full MCP functionality verified through Claude Code integration
- **Configuration Testing**: Multiple deployment scenarios validated (internal/external Qdrant, with/without ingress)

**Chart Features Delivered**:
- **Single Chart**: Unified chart supporting multiple deployment patterns
- **Flexible Configuration**: Comprehensive values.yaml for customization
- **Production Ready**: Proper resource limits, RBAC, health considerations
- **Client Compatibility**: HTTP transport with proper ingress configuration for MCP clients
- **Documentation**: Well-commented configuration with clear usage patterns

**Next Session Priorities**:
1. Begin CI/CD automation for coordinated Docker image + Helm chart releases
2. Add OCI chart publishing to GitHub Container Registry  
3. Update Chart.yaml version management and appVersion synchronization
4. Consider Milestone 4: ToolHive integration implementation
5. Create comprehensive user documentation for Helm chart deployment

### 2025-09-09 (Session 5)
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Primary Focus**: Milestone 5 - CI/CD Automation for Coordinated Releases

**Completed PRD Items**:
- [x] **Milestone 5**: CI/CD automation for coordinated Docker image + Helm chart releases with OCI publishing (100% complete)
  - Designed and implemented consolidated atomic release workflow
  - Single `release` job handles npm + Docker + Helm publishing atomically
  - Automated version synchronization (package.json → Chart.yaml appVersion + values.yaml image.tag)
  - OCI chart publishing to GitHub Container Registry
  - Coordinated git commits with meaningful release notes
  - True atomicity: all artifacts published together or none at all

**Strategic Design Decisions**:
- **Decision 4**: Consolidated atomic release job (eliminates duplication, ensures atomicity)
- **Decision 5**: Automated version synchronization from package.json as single source of truth
- **Decision 6**: Complete development first, then test with published artifacts strategy

**Technical Achievements**:
- **Workflow Optimization**: Reduced CI from 402 lines to 297 lines while adding Helm publishing
- **Job Consolidation**: Combined publish + docker + helm-chart into single atomic `release` job
- **Version Coordination**: Package.json version drives Docker image tags and Helm chart appVersion
- **Artifact Publishing**: All artifacts (npm, Docker, Helm) published to GitHub Container Registry
- **Git History Management**: Single commit with coordinated version changes across all files

**Implementation Validation**:
- CI workflow structure verified and optimized
- All version synchronization logic implemented
- Atomic release process designed for fail-safe publishing
- Added Milestone 8 for final integration testing with published artifacts

**Next Session Priorities**:
1. Complete Milestone 4: ToolHive integration (MCPServer CRD implementation)
2. Complete Milestone 6: Client integration testing (session persistence, load balancing)
3. Complete Milestone 7: Comprehensive deployment documentation
4. Prepare comprehensive PR for final integration testing

### 2025-09-09 (Session 6)
**Duration**: ~3 hours  
**Primary Focus**: Milestone 4 - ToolHive Integration Implementation and Testing

**Completed PRD Items**:
- [x] **Milestone 4**: ToolHive Integration (4/5 items complete - documentation moved to Milestone 7)
  - MCPServer CRD manifest created with comprehensive configuration
  - Full integration with ToolHive operator tested and validated
  - Dual deployment architecture implemented in single Helm chart
  - All networking issues resolved (proxy configuration, port mapping, service routing)
  - Session mode configuration optimized for multi-client support
  - Complete end-to-end testing with Claude Code MCP client

**Critical Implementation Work**:
- **MCPServer Template**: Created complete `charts/templates/mcpserver.yaml` with:
  - `toolhive.stacklok.dev/v1alpha1` API version using `streamable-http` transport
  - Container naming requirement: `mcp` (mandatory for ToolHive compatibility)
  - Port configuration: `port: 3456` and `targetPort: 3456` for proper routing
  - Session mode: `SESSION_MODE=stateless` for multi-client MCP connections
  - Permission profile: `builtin/network` for Kubernetes API access
  - Resource limits optimized for ToolHive proxy overhead

- **Chart Integration**: Enhanced existing Helm chart with dual deployment support:
  - Added `deployment.method: standard|toolhive` configuration in values.yaml
  - Updated deployment.yaml, service.yaml with conditional `{{- if eq .Values.deployment.method "standard" }}`
  - Fixed ingress.yaml to route to correct service: `mcp-{name}-proxy` for ToolHive vs `{name}` for standard
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing standard deployments

**Technical Problem Resolution**:
- **Image Version Issue**: Resolved pod exit issue by using correct test image `ghcr.io/vfarcic/dot-ai:0.83.0-test.10`
- **Container Naming**: Fixed ToolHive proxy failure by renaming container from "dot-ai" to "mcp" per CRD requirements
- **Port Configuration**: Resolved 502 Bad Gateway by adding `targetPort: 3456` to MCPServer spec
- **Session Mode**: Fixed "Server already initialized" error by setting `SESSION_MODE=stateless`
- **Service Routing**: Fixed ingress to conditionally route to `mcp-dot-ai-proxy` service for ToolHive deployments

**Validation Evidence**:
- ✅ **ToolHive Deployment**: `kubectl get mcpserver` shows `dot-ai` MCPServer resource created and ready
- ✅ **Pod Status**: ToolHive pods showing 2/2 ready (MCP server + proxy containers)
- ✅ **Network Connectivity**: Port-forwarding and ingress both working with HTTP transport
- ✅ **MCP Client Integration**: Claude Code successfully connecting via HTTP/SSE transport
- ✅ **Functional Testing**: MCP status showing "overall: healthy", capability scanning operational
- ✅ **Multi-Client Support**: Stateless session mode enabling multiple concurrent connections

**Key Technical Insights**:
- **ToolHive Architecture**: ToolHive creates proxy services (`mcp-{name}-proxy`) that handle STDIO-to-HTTP translation
- **Container Requirements**: ToolHive operator requires container to be named exactly "mcp" for proper proxy routing
- **Session Management**: Stateless mode required for Claude Code compatibility (stateful mode only allows single initialization)
- **Port Mapping**: Both `port` and `targetPort` must be specified in MCPServer spec for proper networking

**Implementation Files Created/Modified**:
- **New**: `charts/templates/mcpserver.yaml` - Complete MCPServer CRD template
- **Modified**: `charts/values.yaml` - Added `deployment.method` configuration
- **Modified**: `charts/templates/deployment.yaml` - Added conditional rendering for standard method
- **Modified**: `charts/templates/service.yaml` - Added conditional rendering for standard method
- **Modified**: `charts/templates/ingress.yaml` - Added conditional service routing for both methods
- **Deleted**: Removed obsolete policy files from k8s/policies/

**Next Session Priorities**:
1. Complete Milestone 6: Client integration testing (session persistence, load balancing, performance benchmarks)
2. Complete Milestone 7: Comprehensive deployment documentation (ToolHive + Traditional K8s guides)
3. Consider health check endpoints implementation for production readiness
4. Prepare comprehensive PR for final integration testing with published artifacts

### 2025-09-09 (Session 7)
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Primary Focus**: Milestone 6 - Multi-Client Session Testing and Validation

**Completed PRD Items**:
- [x] **Milestone 6**: Multi-client concurrent access verified - Evidence: Two Claude Code instances running MCP commands simultaneously without conflicts
- [x] Session isolation validated with stateless architecture - Evidence: No "Server already initialized" errors during concurrent operations
- [x] Both deployment methods support concurrent clients - Evidence: ToolHive and Traditional K8s both handling multiple clients successfully
- [x] Data persistence across deployment switches - Evidence: 4 capabilities maintained through ToolHive → Traditional deployment transition

**Critical Validation Evidence**:
- **ToolHive Deployment Testing**: Concurrent capability scanning (`sqls.devopstoolkit.live` + `Pod` + `Service`) with multiple Claude Code instances
- **Traditional Deployment Testing**: Seamless deployment method switching with `ConfigMap` scanning addition during concurrent access
- **Session Architecture Validation**: `SESSION_MODE=stateless` preventing session conflicts and enabling true multi-client support
