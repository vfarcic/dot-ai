# PRD-45: Infrastructure Deployment Documentation and User Experience

**Status**: Draft  
**Created**: 2025-08-05  
**GitHub Issue**: [#45](https://github.com/vfarcic/dot-ai/issues/45)  
**Dependencies**: [PRD #43](./43-dependency-aware-resource-discovery.md) and [PRD #44](./44-semantic-resource-matching.md)  
**Related PRDs**: Completes work initiated in [PRD #19](./19-extend-solution-support.md)

## Executive Summary

While dot-ai's architecture already supports infrastructure deployment, users need comprehensive documentation, examples, and validated workflows to effectively use these capabilities. This PRD creates the complete user experience layer once the underlying recommendation engine is enhanced through PRDs #43 and #44.

## Problem Statement

### Current State After PRD #19
- **Tool descriptions updated**: Infrastructure bias removed from MCP tools ✅
- **AI prompts enhanced**: Infrastructure examples added to prompts ✅  
- **Core functionality available**: System can recommend any Kubernetes resource ✅

### Missing User Experience Components
- **No infrastructure examples**: Users don't know they can deploy databases, operators, networking
- **Incomplete documentation**: MCP guide and README lack infrastructure deployment workflows
- **Unvalidated workflows**: No tested examples proving infrastructure deployment works reliably
- **Poor discoverability**: Users assume system is application-only due to missing examples

### Dependency on Enhanced Recommendation Engine
Current recommendation quality issues prevent effective documentation:
- Missing composite resources (sqls.devopstoolkit.live not found)
- Incomplete organizational patterns (User resources missing from PostgreSQL)
- AI information overload (415 resources causing suboptimal recommendations)
- Missing dependency awareness (ResourceGroup not included for Azure deployments)

## Success Criteria

### Primary Goals
- **Complete Documentation**: MCP guide and README fully document infrastructure capabilities
- **Validated Examples**: All infrastructure examples tested and working reliably
- **Seamless User Experience**: Clear path from intent to successful infrastructure deployment
- **Cross-Reference Integrity**: All documentation links and workflows function correctly

### Success Metrics
- Infrastructure deployment examples execute successfully 100% of the time
- User can complete PostgreSQL, Redis, Ingress, and monitoring deployments following documentation
- Documentation covers major Kubernetes resource categories beyond applications
- Cross-references between application and infrastructure docs work correctly

## Solution Architecture

### Documentation Enhancement Strategy

Built on enhanced recommendation engine from PRDs #43 and #44:

```
Enhanced Recommendation Engine (PRDs #43/#44)
↓
High-Quality Infrastructure Recommendations  
↓
Accurate Documentation & Examples (This PRD)
↓
Optimal User Experience
```

### Content Architecture

#### 1. MCP Guide Enhancement (`docs/mcp-guide.md`)
Add infrastructure deployment sections alongside existing application examples:

```markdown
## Infrastructure Deployment Examples

### Database Deployment
- PostgreSQL with high availability
- Redis cache deployment  
- MongoDB operator installation

### Networking Configuration
- Ingress controller setup
- Load balancer configuration
- Network policy implementation

### Monitoring Stack
- Prometheus operator deployment
- Grafana dashboard setup
- AlertManager configuration
```

#### 2. README Enhancement
Update capability overview to highlight infrastructure support:

```markdown
## Key Capabilities
- **Application Deployment**: Deploy applications with intelligent resource recommendations
- **Infrastructure Deployment**: Deploy databases, networking, storage, and monitoring infrastructure
- **Operator Management**: Install and configure Kubernetes operators
- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Work with any cloud provider or on-premises cluster
```

#### 3. End-to-End User Journeys
Document complete workflows from intent to working infrastructure:

- **Primary Journey**: User describes need → Gets recommendations → Deploys infrastructure → Validates deployment
- **Secondary Journeys**: Networking setup, storage configuration, operator installation
- **Integration Patterns**: How infrastructure and applications work together

## Technical Implementation

### Documentation Components

#### 1. Example Collection and Validation
Create tested examples for major infrastructure categories:

```typescript
const infrastructureExamples = {
  databases: [
    { intent: "PostgreSQL with HA", expectedResources: ["SQL", "ResourceGroup"] },
    { intent: "Redis cache", expectedResources: ["Redis", "ConfigMap"] },
    { intent: "MongoDB replica set", expectedResources: ["MongoDB", "Secret"] }
  ],
  networking: [
    { intent: "Ingress controller", expectedResources: ["IngressController", "Service"] },
    { intent: "Load balancer", expectedResources: ["LoadBalancer", "Service"] }
  ],
  monitoring: [
    { intent: "Prometheus stack", expectedResources: ["Prometheus", "Grafana"] }
  ]
};
```

#### 2. Automated Example Validation
Ensure all documented examples work with enhanced recommendation engine:

```bash
# Validate each example produces expected recommendations
for example in $infrastructureExamples; do
  result=$(dot-ai recommend "$example.intent")
  validate_contains_resources "$result" "$example.expectedResources"
done
```

#### 3. Cross-Reference Validation System
Verify all documentation links and workflows:

```typescript
const crossReferences = [
  { from: "README.md", to: "docs/mcp-guide.md#infrastructure" },
  { from: "mcp-guide.md", to: "examples/postgres-deployment.md" },
  { from: "infrastructure-examples", to: "application-integration-patterns" }
];
```

## Risk Assessment

### Documentation Risks
- **Example Obsolescence**: Infrastructure examples may become outdated as recommendation engine evolves
- **Complexity Overwhelm**: Too many examples might confuse users about which approach to use
- **Integration Gaps**: Infrastructure and application documentation might not connect well

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Automated Validation**: All examples tested automatically to catch obsolescence
- **Curated Selection**: Focus on most common use cases rather than comprehensive coverage
- **Clear Integration Patterns**: Explicit guidance on infrastructure-application relationships

## Dependencies and Assumptions

### Critical Dependencies
- **PRD #43 Complete**: Dependency-aware resource discovery working (ResourceGroup included automatically)
- **PRD #44 Complete**: Semantic resource matching working (sqls.devopstoolkit.live found for PostgreSQL)
- **Stable Recommendation Quality**: Enhanced engine produces consistent, optimal recommendations

### Assumptions
- Infrastructure deployment recommendations will be significantly improved after PRDs #43/#44
- Current infrastructure examples will work reliably once recommendation engine is enhanced
- Users will adopt infrastructure deployment capabilities once properly documented

## Related Work

### Builds Upon
- **PRD #19**: Tool descriptions and prompt enhancements (foundational work completed)
- **PRD #43**: Dependency-aware discovery (provides complete solutions for documentation)
- **PRD #44**: Semantic matching (ensures optimal resources are recommended in examples)

### Enables Future Work

### Example Documentation Structure

**MCP Guide Infrastructure Section:**
```markdown
## Infrastructure Deployment

### Databases
Learn how to deploy and manage databases using dot-ai recommendations.

#### PostgreSQL High Availability Setup
```bash
dot-ai:recommend "PostgreSQL database with high availability on Azure"
```
Expected resources: ResourceGroup, Server, FirewallRule, or SQL composite resource

#### Redis Cache Deployment  
```bash
dot-ai:recommend "Redis cache for session storage"
```
Expected resources: Redis operator or StatefulSet with persistent storage

### Networking Infrastructure
Configure networking components for your applications.

### Monitoring and Observability
Set up comprehensive monitoring for your cluster.
```

This structure ensures infrastructure deployment is presented as naturally as application deployment, with the same level of detail and support.
