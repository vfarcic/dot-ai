# PRD: Docker and Kubernetes Deployment Support for MCP

**GitHub Issue:** [#64](https://github.com/vfarcic/dot-ai/issues/64)

## Problem Statement

Currently, the DevOps AI Toolkit MCP server can only be run via `npx`, which creates several limitations:

### Current Limitations
1. **Development Environment Dependency** - Requires Node.js runtime and npm/npx on client machines
2. **No Containerized Deployment** - Cannot leverage Docker for consistent, isolated environments
3. **Limited Kubernetes Integration** - No native support for running in Kubernetes clusters
4. **Manual Configuration Management** - Secrets and configuration must be managed locally
5. **No Scalability Options** - Cannot scale horizontally or leverage Kubernetes orchestration features
6. **Production Deployment Gaps** - Lacks enterprise deployment patterns for production environments

### User Impact
- **Developers** struggle with local environment setup and dependency management
- **Platform Engineers** cannot integrate MCP into existing Kubernetes-based infrastructure
- **Enterprise Users** lack secure, scalable deployment options for production use
- **CI/CD Pipelines** cannot easily incorporate MCP functionality into automated workflows

## Solution Overview

Implement comprehensive containerization and Kubernetes deployment support through:

1. **Enhanced Docker Deployment** - Improve existing Docker images with comprehensive documentation
2. **Kubernetes Deployment Options** - Research and document multiple deployment patterns
3. **Helm Chart Automation** - Automated Helm chart builds and OCI registry storage
4. **Production-Ready Documentation** - Complete deployment guides for all supported methods

## Success Metrics

### Technical Success
- [x] Docker Compose setup working with MCP + Qdrant in <5 minutes
- [x] Docker Compose configurations for development and production
- [x] Configurable Docker images via environment variables
- [x] MCP client connection configuration working
- [x] ~~Docker MCP Catalog submission approved and listed~~ - Scope reduced: Removed due to Claude Code timeout issues with Docker MCP Gateway
- [x] ~~Kubernetes deployment successful~~ - Scope reduced: Kubernetes deployment abandoned after compatibility research
- [x] ~~Helm chart automated build~~ - Scope reduced: Not applicable without Kubernetes deployment
- [x] All deployment methods documented with working examples - Evidence: Docker, NPX, and Development setup guides all completed with MCP configurations

### User Success  
- [x] 90% reduction in setup time for containerized deployments - Evidence: Docker setup reduced from 30+ min manual Qdrant setup to 2-command process
- [x] ~~Support for enterprise Kubernetes environments~~ - Scope reduced: Kubernetes approach abandoned
- [x] Zero-dependency deployment (no local Node.js/npm required) - Evidence: Docker Compose deployment working with no Node.js installation required
- [x] ~~Automated secret management and configuration templating~~ - Scope reduced: Kubernetes-specific feature no longer applicable

## Detailed Solution Design

### Phase 1: Enhanced Docker Support

#### 1.1 Docker Deployment Documentation
<!-- PRD-64 -->

**Docker Deployment Scenarios:**
- **Single Container**: MCP server only (external Qdrant)
- **Docker Compose**: MCP + Qdrant together
- **Docker Desktop Integration**: One-click deployment via Docker MCP Catalog
- **Gordon MCP Format**: `gordon-mcp.yml` configuration pattern alignment
- **Development Setup**: Hot-reload and debugging support
- **Production Setup**: Multi-stage builds, security hardening

#### 1.2 Docker Compose Configuration
**File:** `docker-compose.yml` (new)
- MCP server container with proper environment configuration
- Qdrant container with persistent storage
- Network configuration for service discovery
- Volume mounts for session persistence and configuration

**File:** `gordon-mcp.yml` (new)

### Phase 2: Kubernetes Deployment Options Research & Implementation

#### 2.1 Kubernetes Orchestration Options Investigation
<!-- PRD-64 -->
**Research and evaluate the following approaches:**

**Option 1: Toolhive Operator**
- Purpose-built for MCP server deployments
- Enterprise security and operator-managed lifecycle
- Custom MCPServer CRD with built-in security profiles
- Pros: Security-first design, MCP-specific features, simplified management
- Cons: Additional operator dependency, newer ecosystem

**Option 2: Direct Kubernetes Manifests**
- Traditional StatefulSet + Service + ConfigMap + Secret approach
- Direct control over all Kubernetes resources
- Pros: No operator dependencies, full control, widely understood
- Cons: More complex configuration, manual security hardening required

**Option 3: Existing MCP Kubernetes Operators**
- `containers/kubernetes-mcp-server`: Kubernetes and OpenShift focused
- `alexei-led/k8s-mcp-server`: Multi-tool CLI operations (kubectl, helm, istioctl, argocd)
- `Flux159/mcp-server-kubernetes`: Cluster management operations
- Pros: Purpose-built for MCP, existing community solutions
- Cons: May not fit our specific use case, different feature sets

**Option 4: Sidecar Container Pattern**
- Deploy MCP as sidecar alongside application containers
- Shared lifecycle and networking with main application
- Pros: Co-location benefits, application-specific configuration
- Cons: Increased resource overhead per pod, complex networking

**Decision Criteria:**
- Ease of setup and maintenance
- Security and enterprise readiness
- Community adoption and support
- Compatibility with existing infrastructure

#### 2.2 Kubernetes Documentation Structure
<!-- PRD-64 -->
**New Documentation Files:**
- `docs/kubernetes-deployment-guide.md` - Master Kubernetes deployment guide
- Additional specific guides based on chosen deployment patterns

### Phase 3: Helm Chart Development

## Decision Log

### Decision: Integrate with Docker's Official MCP Ecosystem
**Date**: 2025-01-16  
**Decision**: Align Docker deployment approach with Docker's official MCP Catalog and Toolkit patterns  
**Rationale**: Docker provides official MCP support through MCP Catalog (100+ verified servers) and MCP Toolkit (one-click deployment). This provides enterprise validation, broader discoverability, and simplified user experience.  
**Impact**: 
- **Requirements**: Added Docker Desktop integration and Docker MCP Catalog submission
- **Implementation**: Added `gordon-mcp.yml` configuration and Docker Desktop documentation
- **Code**: No MCP server code changes required - existing implementation compatible
- **Timeline**: Minimal impact - leverages existing Docker approach
- **Risk**: Low - additive improvements with fallback to standard Docker Compose

**Owner**: Implementation Team

### Decision: Simplify Docker Compose for Development Use Case
**Date**: 2025-01-16  
**Decision**: Remove unnecessary complexity from Docker Compose configuration for development and testing use case  
**Rationale**: Docker Compose is primarily for development/testing, not production (Kubernetes handles production). Removing arbitrary resource limits, complex health checks, and unused environment variables improves usability and reduces maintenance overhead.  
**Impact**:
- **Requirements**: Removed production-oriented Docker Compose features
- **Implementation**: Simplified environment variables, removed resource constraints, fixed health checks
- **Code**: Working Docker Compose implementation with `docker-compose.yml` completed
- **Timeline**: Accelerated - reduced complexity speeds up implementation
- **Risk**: Low - focuses on primary use case without compromising functionality

**Owner**: Implementation Team

### Decision: Reject Gordon MCP Integration
**Date**: 2025-01-16  
**Decision**: Do not create `gordon-mcp.yml` configuration for Docker's Gordon AI assistant  
**Rationale**: Target audience mismatch - Gordon users are Docker-focused beginners/intermediates, while our MCP targets Kubernetes practitioners. The complexity gap and workflow mismatch would create poor user experience without clear value.  
**Impact**:
- **Requirements**: Removed Gordon integration from success metrics and deliverables
- **Scope**: Narrowed focus to MCP clients used by Kubernetes practitioners (Claude Code, Cursor)
- **Implementation**: Removed `gordon-mcp.yml` from Milestone 1 deliverables
- **Timeline**: Minor reduction - eliminates non-aligned work
- **Risk**: Low - focuses resources on aligned target audience

**Owner**: Implementation Team

### Decision: Make Docker Primary Deployment Method Over npx
**Date**: 2025-01-16  
**Decision**: Position Docker as the primary deployment method rather than alternative to npx  
**Rationale**: Docker provides superior isolation, consistency, and enterprise readiness compared to npx-based deployment. Users prefer containerized deployments for production and development environments.  
**Impact**:
- **Requirements**: Documentation architecture restructured to present Docker first
- **Implementation**: Update `docs/mcp-setup.md` to lead with Docker deployment section
- **Scope**: Docker becomes primary focus with comprehensive examples and troubleshooting
- **Timeline**: Documentation restructuring required in Milestone 1
- **Risk**: Low - improves user experience by leading with preferred deployment method

**Owner**: Implementation Team

### Decision: Container Lifecycle Management with MCP Protocol Compatibility  
**Date**: 2025-01-16  
**Decision**: Use `docker compose run --rm --remove-orphans` instead of `docker compose up --abort-on-container-exit`  
**Rationale**: MCP protocol requires direct stdin/stdout communication. `docker compose up` adds log prefixes (`dot-ai |`) that break MCP protocol communication, while `docker compose run` provides clean stdio interface required by MCP clients.  
**Impact**:
- **Requirements**: MCP client configuration must use `run` command for protocol compatibility
- **Implementation**: Updated `.mcp.json` and `.mcp-docker.json` with working configuration
- **Code**: Container cleanup handled by `--remove-orphans` flag
- **Timeline**: Resolved in current implementation session
- **Risk**: Low - maintains MCP functionality while providing container cleanup

**Owner**: Implementation Team

### Decision: Rename Docker Compose File to Avoid Project Conflicts
**Date**: 2025-08-16  
**Decision**: Rename `docker-compose.yml` to `docker-compose-dot-ai.yaml` and update MCP configuration to use `-f` flag  
**Rationale**: Users often have existing `docker-compose.yml` files in their projects for other purposes. Using a specific filename prevents conflicts and makes it clear the file is for dot-ai deployment.  
**Impact**:
- **Requirements**: Added requirement for non-conflicting file naming in setup process
- **Implementation**: File renamed and `.mcp-docker.json` updated with `-f docker-compose-dot-ai.yaml` flag
- **Code**: MCP client configuration now includes explicit file reference
- **User Experience**: Simplified setup instructions with clear file purpose
- **Timeline**: Immediate implementation - completed in current session
- **Risk**: Low - improves usability without compromising functionality

**Owner**: Implementation Team

### Decision: Simplify Docker Setup with Download Instructions Over Remote URLs
**Date**: 2025-08-16  
**Decision**: Provide curl-based download instructions instead of exploring complex remote Docker Compose URL approaches  
**Rationale**: Docker Compose cannot directly reference remote files via URL. Rather than using complex workarounds, simple curl download instructions provide clean, understandable setup for users.  
**Impact**:
- **Requirements**: Documentation must include clear download instructions using curl commands
- **Implementation**: Two-step setup process: download compose file, download MCP config
- **User Experience**: Standard developer workflow (curl download) that's familiar and reliable
- **Code**: No code changes required - leverages existing Docker infrastructure
- **Timeline**: Documentation update required in current milestone
- **Risk**: Low - follows standard community practices

**Owner**: Implementation Team

### Decision: Accelerate Docker MCP Catalog Submission to High Priority
**Date**: 2025-08-16  
**Decision**: Immediately prioritize Docker MCP Catalog submission using Docker-built tier for enhanced security and discoverability  
**Rationale**: With Docker infrastructure complete and tested, Docker MCP Catalog submission provides immediate high-value benefits: access to 20+ million developers, enhanced security with cryptographic signatures and SBOMs, and automatic maintenance by Docker. The submission process is well-defined and dot-ai meets all prerequisites.  
**Impact**:
- **Requirements**: Docker MCP Catalog submission moved from pending to active high-priority task
- **Implementation**: Use Docker-built tier for maximum security and trust (mcp/dot-ai namespace)
- **Process**: Fork docker/mcp-registry, use Task CLI wizard, generate server.yaml configuration
- **Timeline**: 24-hour turnaround after approval for catalog listing
- **Benefits**: Cryptographic signatures, provenance tracking, automatic security updates, broader discoverability
- **Prerequisites Met**: Docker image exists, Dockerfile ready, documentation comprehensive, license compatible

**Owner**: Implementation Team

### Decision: Comprehensive MCP Registry Publication Strategy
**Date**: 2025-08-16  
**Decision**: Target multiple high-value MCP registries for maximum discoverability and community reach  
**Rationale**: MCP ecosystem has rapidly expanded since November 2024 launch with multiple major registries emerging. Comprehensive publication strategy maximizes discoverability across developer communities while establishing dot-ai as a recognized Kubernetes deployment solution.  
**Impact**:
- **Requirements**: Multi-registry publication plan for broader market penetration
- **Target Registries**: Docker MCP Catalog (20M+ developers), Official ModelContextProtocol/servers, PulseMCP (5560+ servers), MCP.so community platform
- **Publication Benefits**: Official recognition, community engagement, enterprise discoverability, security validation
- **Timeline**: Parallel submissions after Docker MCP Catalog completion
- **Validation Strategy**: Each registry provides different audience and validation (enterprise, community, official)

**Owner**: Implementation Team

### Decision: Remove Docker MCP Catalog from Project Scope
**Date**: 2025-08-16  
**Decision**: Remove Docker MCP Catalog submission from PRD scope due to integration limitations  
**Rationale**: Research revealed Claude Code has documented timeout issues (120-second tool timeouts) with Docker MCP Gateway integration, while same functionality works in Claude Desktop. Integration problems make Docker MCP Catalog unsuitable for Claude Code users, which are our primary target audience.  
**Impact**:
- **Scope**: Docker MCP Catalog work removed from Milestone 1 deliverables
- **Focus**: Concentrate on alternative MCP registries (Official, PulseMCP, MCP.so) that work reliably with Claude Code
- **Resources**: Redirect effort to documentation creation and other registry submissions
- **Timeline**: Milestone 1 completion accelerated by removing blocked Docker MCP Catalog work
- **Future**: Can revisit when Claude Code + Docker Desktop integration issues are resolved

**Owner**: Implementation Team

### Decision: Hub-and-Spoke Documentation Architecture Pattern
**Date**: 2025-08-17  
**Decision**: Establish centralized hub documentation pattern with method-specific spokes for all setup documentation  
**Rationale**: Docker setup documentation revealed that duplicating common concepts (environment variables, troubleshooting, security) across method guides creates maintenance overhead and inconsistent user experience. Hub-and-spoke pattern provides single source of truth for shared concepts while allowing method-specific details.  
**Impact**:
- **Architecture**: `docs/mcp-setup.md` as hub, `docs/setup/[method]-setup.md` as spokes
- **Content Strategy**: Shared concepts (env vars, troubleshooting, security) centralized in hub
- **Method Guides**: Focus purely on method-specific setup steps and configurations
- **Maintenance**: Single update point for shared concepts, reduced duplication
- **User Experience**: Consistent guidance with clear method-specific instructions
- **Applied To**: All setup methods (NPX, Docker, Development) must follow this pattern

**Code Impact**: Documentation structure standardized across all setup methods
**Owner**: Implementation Team

### Decision: Environment Variable Management Centralization
**Date**: 2025-08-17  
**Decision**: Centralize generic `.env` file concepts and security practices in hub, keep only method-specific variables in individual setup guides  
**Rationale**: Environment variable management is universal across all setup methods. Docker guide initially duplicated `.env` creation, security practices, and usage patterns that apply equally to NPX and development setups. Centralization eliminates duplication and ensures consistency.  
**Impact**:
- **Hub Content**: Generic `.env` creation, security best practices, usage patterns
- **Method-Specific Content**: Only variables unique to that setup method (e.g., Docker image names)
- **Reference Pattern**: Individual guides reference hub for general `.env` guidance
- **Consistency**: All setup methods use same environment variable security practices
- **Applied To**: NPX and development setup guides must follow this centralization pattern

**Code Impact**: Documentation references standardized for environment variable management
**Owner**: Implementation Team

### Decision: MCP Client Workflow-Focused Documentation
**Date**: 2025-08-17  
**Decision**: Eliminate manual commands that users won't run in actual MCP client workflow from all setup documentation  
**Rationale**: Docker documentation initially included manual Docker Compose commands (service management, health checks, performance monitoring) that users never run because MCP clients handle container lifecycle automatically. This pattern applies to all setup methods.  
**Impact**:
- **Content Focus**: Document only commands users actually run in MCP workflow
- **Elimination Strategy**: Remove manual service management, debugging, and diagnostic commands
- **MCP Client Integration**: Focus on MCP configuration and client-based diagnostics (`"Show dot-ai status"`)
- **Applied To**: NPX setup should not include manual npm/node commands users won't run
- **Applied To**: Development setup should focus on contributor workflow, not user workflow
- **User Experience**: Documentation matches actual usage patterns

**Code Impact**: All setup guides must align with MCP client interaction patterns
**Owner**: Implementation Team

### Decision: Centralized Troubleshooting with Status Tool Priority
**Date**: 2025-08-17  
**Decision**: Establish `"Show dot-ai status"` as primary diagnostic approach across all setup methods, centralize generic troubleshooting in hub  
**Rationale**: Docker documentation initially duplicated troubleshooting guidance that applies universally (connection issues, environment variables, basic diagnostics). The version tool provides comprehensive diagnostics that work regardless of setup method.  
**Impact**:
- **Primary Diagnostic**: `"Show dot-ai status"` command established as first troubleshooting step
- **Hub Troubleshooting**: Generic issues (API keys, connectivity) documented centrally
- **Method-Specific**: Only setup-method-specific issues documented in individual guides
- **Tool Integration**: Version tool provides consistent diagnostics across all deployment methods
- **Applied To**: NPX and development guides should reference hub troubleshooting
- **User Experience**: Consistent diagnostic approach regardless of setup method

**Code Impact**: Troubleshooting approach standardized across all documentation
**Owner**: Implementation Team

### Decision: Content Deduplication and Reference Strategy
**Date**: 2025-08-17  
**Decision**: Establish strict deduplication strategy where individual setup guides reference hub content instead of repeating information  
**Rationale**: Docker guide initially repeated MCP client configuration, Next Steps, Security Considerations, and other content already covered elsewhere. This creates maintenance overhead and version drift between duplicated sections.  
**Impact**:
- **Reference Pattern**: "See [Section](../hub-guide.md#section)" instead of content duplication
- **Hub Expansion**: Hub contains all shared concepts (security, next steps, client integration)
- **Method Focus**: Individual guides focus purely on setup mechanics specific to that method
- **Maintenance Efficiency**: Single update point for shared concepts
- **Applied To**: NPX and development guides must follow same reference strategy
- **Quality Control**: No content should appear in multiple places unless method-specific

**Code Impact**: Documentation cross-referencing standardized to prevent duplication
**Owner**: Implementation Team

### Decision: Defer Docker Examples Directory for Higher-Impact Work
**Date**: 2025-08-17  
**Decision**: Defer creation of `examples/deployments/docker/` directory in favor of prioritizing higher-impact remaining work  
**Rationale**: User feedback indicated that Docker examples would duplicate existing documentation without adding significant value. Download instructions in documentation already provide necessary template files and setup guidance. Resources better spent on MCP registry publications or Kubernetes research phases.  
**Impact**:
- **Scope**: Removed `examples/deployments/docker/` from Milestone 1 deliverables
- **Resources**: Redirected effort toward MCP registry publications or Kubernetes deployment research
- **User Experience**: Maintained adequate user support through curl-based download approach in documentation
- **Timeline**: Accelerated Milestone 1 completion, enables focus on higher-value work
- **Milestone Status**: Milestone 1 considered complete without examples directory
- **Future**: Examples can be added later if user feedback indicates genuine need

**Owner**: Implementation Team

### Decision: Abandon Kubernetes Deployment Due to ToolHive Compatibility Issues
**Date**: 2025-08-17  
**Decision**: Discontinue Kubernetes deployment support after comprehensive ToolHive testing revealed fundamental compatibility issues  
**Rationale**: Extensive testing of ToolHive Operator showed that HTTP-to-STDIO bridging consistently fails with 404 errors when connecting Claude Code MCP clients. Multiple transport types (HTTP, SSE) and configurations tested without success. ToolHive's proxy layer cannot properly expose MCP endpoints for client connectivity.  
**Impact**:
- **Scope Reduction**: Remove Kubernetes deployment from project scope
- **Focus**: Concentrate on Docker deployment with external orchestration recommendations
- **Success Metrics**: Mark Kubernetes-related metrics as completed/invalid due to scope change
- **Documentation**: Remove all Kubernetes deployment guides and references
- **Milestones**: Milestones 3-5 (Kubernetes implementation) are no longer applicable

**Technical Evidence**:
- ToolHive proxy returns 404 for all HTTP POST/GET requests to MCP endpoints
- Both HTTP and SSE transports fail with same connectivity issues
- MCP server functions correctly via STDIO but ToolHive bridging is broken
- Multiple image versions (0.1.4, 0.68.1) tested with same results

**Alternative Considered**: Implementing HTTP transport directly in dot-ai MCP server was considered but deemed unnecessary given Docker deployment success.

**Owner**: Implementation Team

### Decision: Adopt ToolHive Operator as Primary Kubernetes Deployment Pattern (SUPERSEDED)
**Date**: 2025-08-17  
**Decision**: Use StackLok's ToolHive Operator as the primary and recommended Kubernetes deployment pattern for dot-ai  
**Rationale**: After comprehensive evaluation of 4 deployment options (ToolHive Operator, Direct Manifests, Existing MCP Operators, Sidecar Pattern), ToolHive emerged as the clear choice due to its enterprise-grade security features, operational simplicity, and perfect architectural fit for MCP server deployments.  
**Impact**:
- **Architecture**: MCPServer Custom Resource Definition with automatic RBAC management
- **Security**: Built-in secret management, container isolation, security-first design
- **Operations**: Helm-based installation, declarative configuration, automatic proxy pod management
- **Compatibility**: Supports existing dot-ai Docker images and environment patterns seamlessly
- **Timeline**: Enables focused implementation effort rather than evaluating multiple patterns
- **Documentation**: Initial Kubernetes deployment guide created with ToolHive focus

**Technical Benefits**:
- **Enterprise Ready**: Automatic RBAC, secret management, security contexts
- **Kubernetes Native**: StatefulSet-based deployment, CRD patterns, operator lifecycle
- **Community Backing**: Developed by StackLok (Kubernetes co-creator), active development
- **Implementation Fit**: Supports STDIO transport, environment variables, volume mounting patterns required by dot-ai

**Alternative Options Considered**:
- **Direct Kubernetes Manifests**: More complex RBAC management, lacks enterprise features
- **Existing MCP Operators** (alexei-led, Flux159, containers): Different focus areas, less comprehensive security
- **Sidecar Pattern**: Higher resource overhead, complex networking patterns

**MCPServer Configuration** (reference from experimental setup):
```yaml
apiVersion: toolhive.stacklok.dev/v1alpha1
kind: MCPServer
metadata:
  name: dot-ai
  namespace: toolhive-system
spec:
  image: ghcr.io/vfarcic/dot-ai:0.1.4
  env:
    - name: KUBECONFIG
      value: "/etc/kubeconfig/config"
  permissionProfile:
    type: builtin
    name: network
  podTemplateSpec:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mcp
          env:
            - name: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: dot-ai-secrets
                  key: anthropic-api-key
          volumeMounts:
            - name: kubeconfig
              mountPath: "/etc/kubeconfig"
              readOnly: true
            - name: sessions
              mountPath: "/app/sessions"
          resources:
            limits:
              cpu: 200m
              memory: 256Mi
            requests:
              cpu: 100m
              memory: 128Mi
      volumes:
        - name: kubeconfig
          secret:
            secretName: dot-ai-kubeconfig
        - name: sessions
          emptyDir: {}
```
