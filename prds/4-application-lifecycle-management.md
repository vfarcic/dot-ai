### Supporting Materials
- [Kubernetes Deployment Strategies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) - For update strategy implementation
- [Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaling](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) - For automated scaling integration
- [Existing dot-ai MCP Patterns](./src/interfaces/mcp.ts) - For tool structure consistency

### Research Findings
- Zero-downtime updates require careful coordination of health checks and traffic routing
- Automated scaling effectiveness depends on appropriate metrics and thresholds
- Configuration management complexity increases significantly with environment proliferation
- Safe deletion requires comprehensive dependency mapping and validation

### Example Lifecycle Commands
```bash
# Update operations
dot-ai update my-app --version v2.0.0 --strategy rolling
dot-ai rollback my-app --to-version v1.9.0

# Scaling operations
dot-ai scale my-app --replicas 5
dot-ai scale my-app --auto --target-cpu 70%

# Configuration management
dot-ai config my-app --set ENV=production
dot-ai config my-app --file production.yaml

# Lifecycle management
dot-ai delete my-app --confirm --cleanup-all
dot-ai backup my-app --include-data
```
