# PRD: Policy Generation Provider Filtering

**Status**: Draft  
**Created**: 2025-09-01  
**GitHub Issue**: [#87](https://github.com/vfarcic/dot-ai/issues/87)

## Problem Statement

The policy generation system incorrectly includes resources from wrong cloud providers when generating Kyverno policies. When a policy intent mentions a specific provider, the generated policy should only include resources from that provider, but currently includes resources from unrelated providers.

### Illustrative Example (Representative of Broader Issue)

**Intent**: "Databases in Google Cloud (GCP) should always run in the us-east1 region"

**Current Behavior**: Generated policy includes:
- ✅ `databaseinstances.sql.gcp.m.upbound.io` (correct - GCP resource)
- ❌ `manageddatabaseopensearches.database.upcloud.com` (incorrect - UpCloud resource)
- ❌ `manageddatabaseredis.database.upcloud.com` (incorrect - UpCloud resource)
- ❌ `manageddatabasemysqls.database.upcloud.com` (incorrect - UpCloud resource)

**Expected Behavior**: Only GCP database resources should be included.

**Note**: This issue affects ANY provider-specific intent, not just GCP. The same problem occurs with AWS-specific intents including Azure resources, DigitalOcean-specific intents including Linode resources, etc.

### Root Cause Analysis

Through investigation, we identified multiple contributing factors:

1. **Information Asymmetry**: Policy generation AI receives minimal schema information (`kubectl explain --recursive`) while capability inference AI gets rich CRD definitions (`kubectl get crd -o yaml`) with detailed descriptions and metadata.

2. **Missing Provider Context**: The semantic search correctly finds all functionally-related resources, but the policy generation AI lacks instructions on how to filter based on provider context from the intent.

3. **No Provider Filtering Instructions**: The current AI prompt instructs the AI to analyze ALL provided schemas without considering provider relevance.

## User Impact

### Current Pain Points
- **Invalid Policies**: Generated policies contain rules for resources from wrong providers
- **Manual Cleanup Required**: Users must manually edit generated policies to remove irrelevant rules
- **Reduced Trust**: Users lose confidence in AI-generated policies
- **Universal Problem**: Affects ANY provider-specific intent (not just major cloud providers)

### Success Metrics
- **Accuracy**: 100% of generated policies contain only resources matching the intent's provider context
- **Universal Coverage**: Works for any provider (established clouds, niche providers, custom operators)
- **User Experience**: Zero manual cleanup required for provider-specific intents

## Solution Approach

### Core Strategy
Enhance policy generation with provider-aware filtering by ensuring the AI has both rich schema information AND explicit filtering instructions that work for ANY provider.

### Solution Components

#### 1. Schema Information Enhancement
**Problem**: Policy generation AI gets minimal schema info compared to capability inference AI.

**Solution**: Update schema retrieval in policy generation to match capability inference approach:
- **Custom Resources (CRDs)**: Use `kubectl get crd resourcename -o yaml` instead of `kubectl explain`
- **Core Resources**: Continue using `kubectl explain --recursive`
- **Result**: Policy AI gets same rich descriptions, validation rules, and metadata that capability AI uses

#### 2. AI Prompt Enhancement
**Problem**: No instructions for provider context filtering.

**Solution**: Add provider filtering section to `prompts/kyverno-generation.md`:
- Instructions to extract provider context from policy intent (any provider, not just major ones)
- Guidelines to match resources to providers using schema metadata and naming patterns
- Requirements to document filtering decisions in generated policy comments
- Examples covering various provider types (major clouds, niche providers, custom operators)

#### 3. Metadata Integration (Fallback)
**Problem**: If CRD definitions don't provide sufficient provider context.

**Solution**: Pass capability metadata alongside schemas:
- Include providers, capabilities, description, use case from vector database
- Format metadata clearly for AI consumption
- Provide both schema structure AND analyzed metadata

### Technical Implementation

The solution involves changes to:
1. `src/core/unified-creation-session.ts` - Schema retrieval logic
2. `prompts/kyverno-generation.md` - AI filtering instructions for any provider
3. Test suites - Comprehensive provider filtering validation across diverse providers

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: CRD definitions might not contain sufficient provider context for all providers
  - **Mitigation**: Fallback to passing capability metadata if CRD approach insufficient
  - **Probability**: Low (investigation shows CRDs typically have rich provider information)

- **Risk**: Performance impact from retrieving full CRD definitions
  - **Mitigation**: Monitor policy generation time, optimize if needed
  - **Probability**: Low (capability inference already does this successfully)

### User Experience Risks
- **Risk**: AI might over-filter and exclude valid resources for lesser-known providers
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing with diverse providers, clear filtering documentation
  - **Probability**: Medium (requires careful prompt engineering for universal provider support)

- **Risk**: Breaking changes to existing policies
  - **Mitigation**: Extensive regression testing, gradual rollout
  - **Probability**: Low (enhancement should only improve accuracy)

### 2025-09-01: Milestone 2 Complete - Universal Provider Filtering ✅
**Duration**: ~4 hours
**Primary Focus**: AI prompt enhancement with universal provider filtering logic
**Strategy Change**: Reverted Milestone 1 comprehensive schema approach due to token limits, kept AI enhancements

**Completed PRD Items**:
- [x] Add provider context analysis section to kyverno-generation.md prompt
- [x] Include instructions for semantic provider extraction from intents (any provider)  
- [x] Add guidelines for resource-to-provider matching using schema metadata
- [x] Include requirement for filtering decision documentation

- [x] Test major cloud providers (GCP) - End-to-end validation successful

**Implementation Details**:
- Enhanced `prompts/kyverno-generation.md` with Universal Provider Filtering section
- Added 5-method provider detection system working with any provider type
- Enhanced existing comment format to include provider filtering rationale  
- Successfully tested with GCP database policy - perfect provider filtering achieved
- Resolved token limit issues by using lightweight schema retrieval + enhanced AI filtering
- Policy generation now correctly excludes resources from wrong providers

**Validation Results**:
- GCP policy test: ✅ Included only GCP and GCP-compatible resources (`databaseinstances.sql.gcp.m.upbound.io`, `sqls.devopstoolkit.live`)
- Token limits: ✅ No longer hitting 200K+ token limit  
- Provider filtering: ✅ Correctly excluded AWS (`*.rds.aws.m.upbound.io`), UpCloud (`*.database.upcloud.com`), Azure (`*.dbforpostgresql.azure.m.upbound.io`) resources
- Backward compatibility: ✅ Existing functionality preserved

**Architecture Decision**:
Milestone 1's comprehensive schema retrieval (CRD YAML) caused token limit issues (25 resources × 9KB = 225KB > 200K limit). Successfully resolved by reverting to lightweight `kubectl explain` approach (~2.3KB per resource) while keeping enhanced AI prompt filtering. This approach mirrors the working recommendation tool architecture.

**Next Session Priority**: 
Complete remaining validation tests (UpCloud, custom operators, multi-cloud, provider-agnostic)

## Conclusion

This enhancement addresses a critical accuracy issue in policy generation by ensuring universal provider-aware filtering. The solution works for ANY provider type - from major cloud providers to niche services to custom operators. By leveraging existing infrastructure (capability inference approach) while adding explicit AI instructions for provider context, we ensure accurate policy generation regardless of which provider the user specifies. The risk is low, the user impact is high, and the implementation is well-scoped with clear milestones that emphasize universal provider support.
