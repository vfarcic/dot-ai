# PRD: CRD-Based Solution Tracking System

**Created**: 2025-07-28
**Status**: Draft
**Owner**: Viktor Farcic
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-28

## Executive Summary
Implement Kubernetes CRDs for solution storage with state management, GitOps integration, and cluster-native solution tracking beyond session-based storage.

## Documentation Changes

### Files Created/Updated
- **`docs/solution-tracking-guide.md`** - New File - Complete guide for CRD-based solution tracking
- **`docs/gitops-integration-guide.md`** - New File - GitOps workflows with CRD solution tracking
- **`docs/mcp-guide.md`** - MCP Documentation - Add solution management and tracking MCP tools
- **`README.md`** - Project Overview - Add persistent solution tracking to core capabilities
- **`src/core/crds/`** - Technical Implementation - CRD definitions and controllers

### Content Location Map
- **Feature Overview**: See `docs/solution-tracking-guide.md` (Section: "What is Solution Tracking")
- **CRD Architecture**: See `docs/solution-tracking-guide.md` (Section: "CRD-Based Storage")
- **GitOps Integration**: See `docs/gitops-integration-guide.md` (Section: "GitOps Workflows")
- **Setup Instructions**: See `docs/solution-tracking-guide.md` (Section: "Configuration")
- **MCP Tools**: See `docs/mcp-guide.md` (Section: "Solution Management Tools")
- **Examples**: See `docs/solution-tracking-guide.md` (Section: "Usage Examples")

### User Journey Validation
- [ ] **Primary workflow** documented end-to-end: Deploy solution → Store in CRD → Manage lifecycle → GitOps integration
- [ ] **Secondary workflows** have complete coverage: Solution querying, state management, cross-cluster tracking
- [ ] **Cross-references** between session-based and CRD-based workflows work correctly
- [ ] **Examples and commands** are testable via automated validation

## Implementation Requirements
- [ ] **Core functionality**: CRD definitions for solution storage and state management - Documented in `docs/solution-tracking-guide.md` (Section: "CRD Architecture")
- [ ] **User workflows**: Persistent solution lifecycle management - Documented in `docs/solution-tracking-guide.md` (Section: "Solution Management")
- [ ] **GitOps integration**: Seamless integration with GitOps workflows - Documented in `docs/gitops-integration-guide.md`
- [ ] **Performance optimization**: Efficient CRD operations with proper indexing and caching

### Success Criteria
- [ ] **Persistence**: Solutions persist beyond session lifecycles with full state tracking
- [ ] **GitOps ready**: CRD-based solutions integrate seamlessly with GitOps workflows
- [ ] **Cluster native**: Solution tracking uses Kubernetes-native patterns and RBAC
- [ ] **Migration smooth**: Seamless migration from session-based to CRD-based storage

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Core CRD Implementation [Status: ⏳ PENDING]
**Target**: Basic CRD-based solution storage working

**Documentation Changes:**
- [ ] **`docs/solution-tracking-guide.md`**: Create complete CRD solution tracking guide
- [ ] **`docs/mcp-guide.md`**: Add CRD-based solution management MCP tools
- [ ] **`README.md`**: Update capabilities to include persistent solution tracking

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Design Solution CRD schema with state management capabilities
- [ ] Implement CRD controllers for solution lifecycle management
- [ ] Create migration from session-based to CRD-based storage

### Phase 2: GitOps Integration and Advanced Features [Status: ⏳ PENDING]
**Target**: GitOps workflows with advanced solution management

**Documentation Changes:**
- [ ] **`docs/gitops-integration-guide.md`**: Create comprehensive GitOps integration guide
- [ ] **Cross-file validation**: Ensure CRD integration works across all deployment workflows

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Build GitOps integration with ArgoCD/Flux compatibility
- [ ] Implement cross-cluster solution tracking and synchronization
- [ ] Add solution versioning and change management
- [ ] Create advanced querying and filtering capabilities

### Phase 3: Enterprise Features [Status: ⏳ PENDING]
**Target**: Production-ready CRD system with enterprise capabilities

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Add solution backup and disaster recovery
- [ ] Implement audit logging and compliance tracking
- [ ] Create solution templates and policy integration
- [ ] Build monitoring and alerting for solution state changes

## Work Log

### 2025-07-28: PRD Refactoring to Documentation-First Format
**Completed Work**: Refactored PRD #25 to follow new documentation-first guidelines with comprehensive CRD-based solution tracking features.
