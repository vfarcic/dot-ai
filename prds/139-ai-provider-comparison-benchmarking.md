# PRD: AI Provider Performance Comparison & Benchmarking

**Status**: Draft
**Priority**: Medium
**GitHub Issue**: [#139](https://github.com/vfarcic/dot-ai/issues/139)
**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Dependencies**:
- [PRD 136: Tool-Based Agentic Architecture](./136-tool-based-agentic-architecture.md)
- [PRD 137: OpenTelemetry Tracing](./137-opentelemetry-tracing.md)

## Executive Summary

The DevOps AI Toolkit supports multiple AI providers (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini) but lacks comprehensive performance and cost comparison data to help users choose the optimal provider for their use case. This PRD outlines the implementation of an automated benchmarking system that captures detailed metrics and generates data-driven comparison reports.

### Problem Statement

- **No performance data**: Users don't know which provider is fastest for their workload
- **Unknown cost implications**: Actual token usage and costs are not measured
- **Quality uncertainty**: No systematic comparison of AI response quality across providers
- **Blind provider selection**: Users choose based on preference rather than data
- **No reliability metrics**: Test failure rates and error patterns not tracked per provider

### Solution Overview

Build an automated benchmarking framework that:
1. Captures comprehensive metrics during integration test execution
2. Stores benchmark results in structured format in the repository
3. Generates markdown comparison reports with performance, cost, and quality data
4. Enables on-demand benchmarking across all supported providers

## Technical Architecture

### Current State Analysis

**Existing Capabilities**:
- Multi-provider support via `AIProvider` interface (PRD 73)
- Integration test suite covering all MCP tools (44 tests)
- Basic test timing data in logs
- Session files with AI responses

**Missing Capabilities**:
- Token usage tracking (depends on PRD 137: OpenTelemetry)
- Structured benchmark data storage
- Automated comparison report generation
- Quality assessment metrics
- Cost calculations

```

### Data Collection Points

**From OpenTelemetry (PRD 137)**:
- Token counts (input/output per AI call)
- Response latency per provider
- Request success/failure rates
- Retry attempts and fallback usage

**From Integration Tests**:
- Test execution time per provider
- Test pass/fail rates
- Error patterns and messages
- Resource usage (memory, CPU)

**From Session Files**:
- AI response samples for quality comparison
- Remediation analysis accuracy
- Manifest generation quality
- Capability inference precision

  metadata: {
    timestamp: string;

- **Accuracy**: Token counts within 5% of provider billing data
- **Automation**: Full benchmark suite runs with single command
- **Reproducibility**: Consistent results across multiple runs (±10%)

### User Experience Metrics

- **Informed Decisions**: 90%+ of users benchmark before production deployment
- **Community Value**: Public benchmarks attract users evaluating the project

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks

1. **Token Tracking Dependency**: OpenTelemetry implementation delays block cost analysis
   - **Mitigation**: Implement basic benchmarking without token data first, add cost later
   - **Fallback**: Manual token extraction from provider dashboards for initial reports

2. **Provider API Instability**: Rate limits or API changes during benchmarking
   - **Mitigation**: Add retry logic, rate limiting, and graceful degradation
   - **Detection**: Monitor for anomalous results, validate against historical data

3. **Test Environment Variability**: Network latency, cluster state affects consistency
   - **Mitigation**: Use dedicated test cluster, run multiple iterations, report confidence intervals
   - **Validation**: Statistical analysis to detect outliers

### Medium Priority Risks

1. **Pricing Changes**: Provider pricing updates make cost data stale
   - **Mitigation**: Include pricing date in reports, automated pricing update checks
   - **Monitoring**: Monthly pricing validation against provider websites

2. **Quality Subjectivity**: Hard to objectively measure AI response quality
   - **Mitigation**: Focus on measurable criteria (correctness, completeness, format)
   - **Enhancement**: Add manual review workflow for complex quality assessments

3. **Storage Growth**: Benchmark data accumulates over time
   - **Mitigation**: Archive old results, compress historical data, retention policy
   - **Threshold**: Alert when benchmarks/ directory exceeds 100MB

## Documentation Impact

### Files to Create
- `docs/benchmarking-guide.md` - Complete benchmarking workflow guide
- `benchmarks/README.md` - Overview of benchmark system and how to interpret results
- `benchmarks/comparisons/latest.md` - Most recent provider comparison report

### Files to Update
- `README.md` - Add benchmarking section to features
- `docs/ai-providers-guide.md` - Link to benchmark results for provider selection
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Guidelines for contributing benchmark runs

## Future Considerations

### Phase 2 Enhancements
- **Real-time Dashboards**: Live benchmark visualization (Grafana/Prometheus)
- **Continuous Benchmarking**: Automated runs on every release
- **Model Variants**: Compare different models within same provider (GPT-4o vs GPT-4-turbo)
- **Workload Profiles**: Specialized benchmarks for different use cases (simple vs complex)
- **Community Benchmarks**: Accept and aggregate benchmark runs from community
- **A/B Testing Framework**: Compare provider performance in production

### Integration Opportunities
- **Cost Optimizer**: Automatic provider switching based on cost thresholds
- **Smart Routing**: Route queries to optimal provider based on workload type
- **Performance SLOs**: Alert when provider performance degrades beyond thresholds

## Decision Log

### ✅ Decision: Public Benchmark Results
- **Date**: 2025-10-04
- **Decision**: Store benchmark results in public GitHub repository
- **Rationale**:
  - Transparency builds trust with users
  - Helps potential users evaluate the project
  - Enables community contributions and validation
  - No sensitive data in benchmark results
- **Impact**: All benchmark data and reports visible in `benchmarks/` directory
- **Owner**: Project Maintainers

### ✅ Decision: Static Reports Over Real-time Dashboards
- **Date**: 2025-10-04
- **Decision**: Generate markdown reports instead of live dashboards (Phase 1)
- **Rationale**:
  - Simpler implementation, faster time to value
  - Works with existing documentation workflow
  - No infrastructure dependencies (no Grafana/Prometheus)
  - Easier for users to consume (just read markdown)
  - Dashboards can be added later if demand exists
- **Impact**: Milestone 4 focuses on markdown generation, dashboard moved to Phase 2
- **Owner**: Development Team

### ✅ Decision: On-Demand Execution Model
- **Date**: 2025-10-04
- **Decision**: Benchmarks run on-demand via `make benchmark`, not automatically on every commit
- **Rationale**:
  - Benchmarks take 20-30 minutes to complete
  - Expensive (AI API costs for 3 providers)
  - Most commits don't affect AI provider performance
  - Manual trigger gives control over when to incur costs
  - Can be run before releases or when evaluating provider changes
- **Impact**: No CI automation in Milestone 5, just manual execution capability
- **Owner**: Development Team
