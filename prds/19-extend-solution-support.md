# PRD: Extend Solution Support Beyond Applications

**Created**: 2025-07-28
**Status**: Draft
**Owner**: Viktor Farcic
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-28

## Executive Summary
Extend dot-ai recommendation system to support infrastructure resources, operators, networking, storage, and other Kubernetes resources beyond application deployments.

## Documentation Changes

### Files Created/Updated
- **`docs/infrastructure-deployment-guide.md`** - New File - Complete guide for infrastructure and resource deployment
- **`docs/solution-types-reference.md`** - New File - Reference for all supported solution types
- **`docs/mcp-guide.md`** - MCP Documentation - Add infrastructure deployment MCP tools
- **`README.md`** - Project Overview - Add infrastructure deployment to core capabilities
- **`src/core/solutions/`** - Technical Implementation - Extended solution support modules

### Content Location Map
- **Feature Overview**: See `docs/infrastructure-deployment-guide.md` (Section: "What is Infrastructure Deployment")
- **Solution Types**: See `docs/solution-types-reference.md` (Section: "Supported Resources")
- **Setup Instructions**: See `docs/infrastructure-deployment-guide.md` (Section: "Configuration")
- **MCP Tools**: See `docs/mcp-guide.md` (Section: "Infrastructure Deployment Tools")
- **Examples**: See `docs/infrastructure-deployment-guide.md` (Section: "Usage Examples")

### User Journey Validation
- [ ] **Primary workflow** documented end-to-end: Describe infrastructure need → Get recommendations → Deploy resources
- [ ] **Secondary workflows** have complete coverage: Networking, storage, operator deployment
- [ ] **Cross-references** between app deployment and infrastructure deployment docs work correctly
- [ ] **Examples and commands** are testable via automated validation

## Implementation Requirements
- [ ] **Core functionality**: Infrastructure resource recommendations and deployment - Documented in `docs/infrastructure-deployment-guide.md`
- [ ] **User workflows**: Networking, storage, and operator deployment workflows - Documented in `docs/solution-types-reference.md`
- [ ] **Performance optimization**: Efficient resource analysis and recommendation generation

### Success Criteria
- [ ] **Resource coverage**: Support for major Kubernetes resource types beyond applications
- [ ] **Recommendation quality**: Accurate infrastructure recommendations based on cluster capabilities
- [ ] **Deployment success**: Successful deployment of infrastructure resources with proper configuration

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Support [Status: ⏳ PENDING]
**Target**: Basic infrastructure resource recommendations working

**Documentation Changes:**
- [ ] **`docs/infrastructure-deployment-guide.md`**: Create complete infrastructure deployment guide
- [ ] **`docs/solution-types-reference.md`**: Document all supported resource types
- [ ] **`README.md`**: Update capabilities to include infrastructure deployment

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Extend recommendation system to support infrastructure resources
- [ ] Implement networking solution patterns (Ingress, NetworkPolicy, Service types)
- [ ] Add storage solution patterns (PVC, StorageClass, Volume configurations)
- [ ] Create operator deployment patterns for common operators

### Phase 2: Advanced Resource Types [Status: ⏳ PENDING]
**Target**: Comprehensive resource type support with specialized patterns

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Add RBAC and security resource patterns
- [ ] Implement configuration and secret management patterns
- [ ] Create monitoring and observability resource patterns
- [ ] Add custom resource definition support

### Phase 3: Integrated Infrastructure Workflows [Status: ⏳ PENDING]
**Target**: Seamless integration between application and infrastructure deployment

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Create infrastructure dependency analysis
- [ ] Implement integrated deployment workflows
- [ ] Add infrastructure cost analysis and optimization
- [ ] Build infrastructure lifecycle management

## Work Log

### 2025-07-28: PRD Refactoring to Documentation-First Format
**Completed Work**: Refactored PRD #19 to follow new documentation-first guidelines with comprehensive infrastructure deployment features.
