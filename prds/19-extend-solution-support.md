# PRD: Extend Solution Support Beyond Applications

**Created**: 2025-07-28
**Status**: Complete
**Owner**: Viktor Farcic
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-05
**Completed**: 2025-08-05

## Executive Summary
Update dot-ai's presentation and examples to clearly communicate its existing capability to recommend and deploy infrastructure resources, operators, networking, storage, and other Kubernetes resources beyond application deployments.

**Key Insight**: Code analysis revealed the system is already architecturally generic and can handle any Kubernetes resource type. The limitation is in application-focused messaging and examples, not core functionality.

## Documentation Changes

## Work Log

### 2025-08-05: Strategic Completion - Documentation Work Moved to PRD #45
**Decision**: Complete PRD #19 with core technical improvements and move remaining documentation work to PRD #45.
**Rationale**: During implementation, discovered that recommendation engine needs enhancement (PRDs #43/#44) before documentation can be accurate. Rather than document suboptimal experiences, moved user-facing work to PRD #45 which depends on enhanced recommendation engine.
**Outcome**: 
- ‚úÖ **Core technical work complete**: Tool descriptions and AI prompts enhanced for infrastructure
- üìã **Documentation work strategically moved**: PRD #45 will provide complete user experience once recommendations are optimized
- üéØ **Clear dependency path**: PRD #43 ‚Üí PRD #44 ‚Üí PRD #45 for complete infrastructure deployment experience
**Owner**: Viktor Farcic
**Status**: Strategic completion - foundational work done, user experience work properly sequenced

### 2025-08-04: Major Strategic Decision - Architectural Simplification
**Decision**: After code analysis, determined the system is already architecturally generic and can handle infrastructure deployments. The issue is presentation/examples, not core functionality.
**Impact**: Simplified implementation from building new systems to updating existing prompts and descriptions.
**Evidence**: Core engine works with any Kubernetes resource type, discovery finds all resources, AI matching uses actual schemas.

### 2025-07-28: PRD Refactoring to Documentation-First Format
**Completed Work**: Refactored PRD #19 to follow new documentation-first guidelines with comprehensive infrastructure deployment features.

## Decision Log

### Decision #1: Architectural Simplification (2025-08-04)
**Decision**: Leverage existing generic architecture instead of building new core functionality
**Rationale**: Code analysis revealed that dot-ai is already architecturally generic:
- Core engine uses `kubectl explain` for ANY resource type
- Discovery finds ALL cluster resources (standard + CRDs)
- AI matching works against actual resource schemas, not predefined categories
- Examples already include infrastructure: "database cluster", "monitoring stack", "load balancer"
**Impact**: 
- **Scope**: Reduced from building new systems to updating existing presentation
- **Timeline**: Significantly faster implementation
- **Risk**: Lower risk since no architectural changes needed
- **Implementation**: Simple prompt/description updates vs. complex 3-phase development
**Owner**: Viktor Farcic
**Status**: Approved

## Appendix

### Resource Types Already Supported (Architecture Analysis)
**The system can already recommend and deploy these resource types:**
- **Networking**: Ingress, Service, NetworkPolicy, EndpointSlice
- **Storage**: PersistentVolumeClaim, StorageClass, Volume configurations  
- **Security**: RBAC roles, ServiceAccount, PodSecurityPolicy
- **Configuration**: ConfigMap, Secret management patterns
- **Operators**: Helm charts, Custom operators, CRD deployments
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL operators, MongoDB, Redis, MySQL
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, AlertManager operators
- **Any Custom Resources**: Automatically discovered via `kubectl api-resources`

**What's needed**: Update prompts and examples to communicate this existing capability clearly to users.
