# PRD: Code Analysis Engine for Automated Recommendation Input

**Created**: 2025-07-28
**Status**: Draft
**Owner**: Viktor Farcic
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-28

## Executive Summary
Build code analysis engine that scans application repositories and automatically generates deployment intent and configuration recommendations, eliminating manual application description.

## Documentation Changes

### Files Created/Updated
- **`docs/code-analysis-guide.md`** - New File - Complete guide for automated code analysis and recommendations
- **`docs/mcp-guide.md`** - MCP Documentation - Add code analysis and repository scanning MCP tools
- **`README.md`** - Project Overview - Add automated code analysis to core capabilities
- **`src/core/analysis/`** - Technical Implementation - Code analysis engine modules

### Content Location Map
- **Feature Overview**: See `docs/code-analysis-guide.md` (Section: "What is Code Analysis")
- **Repository Scanning**: See `docs/code-analysis-guide.md` (Section: "Repository Analysis")
- **Setup Instructions**: See `docs/code-analysis-guide.md` (Section: "Configuration")
- **MCP Tools**: See `docs/mcp-guide.md` (Section: "Code Analysis Tools")
- **Examples**: See `docs/code-analysis-guide.md` (Section: "Usage Examples")

### User Journey Validation
- [ ] **Primary workflow** documented end-to-end: Point to repo → Analyze code → Get deployment recommendations → Deploy
- [ ] **Secondary workflows** have complete coverage: Configuration analysis, dependency detection, optimization suggestions
- [ ] **Cross-references** between manual and automated recommendation workflows work correctly
- [ ] **Examples and commands** are testable via automated validation

## Implementation Requirements
- [ ] **Core functionality**: Repository scanning and code analysis - Documented in `docs/code-analysis-guide.md` (Section: "Analysis Engine")
- [ ] **User workflows**: Automated intent generation and configuration recommendations - Documented in `docs/code-analysis-guide.md` (Section: "Automated Workflows")
- [ ] **Performance optimization**: Efficient code analysis with caching and parallel processing

### Success Criteria
- [ ] **Analysis accuracy**: Accurately identify application type, dependencies, and requirements from code
- [ ] **Recommendation quality**: Generated deployment recommendations match or exceed manual descriptions
- [ ] **Repository support**: Support for major programming languages and frameworks
- [ ] **Integration seamless**: Code analysis integrates smoothly with existing recommendation workflows
