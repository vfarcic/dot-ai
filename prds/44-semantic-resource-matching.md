# PRD-44: Semantic Resource Matching via Vector Database

**Status**: Draft  
**Created**: 2025-08-05  
**GitHub Issue**: [#44](https://github.com/vfarcic/dot-ai/issues/44)  
**Dependencies**: [PRD #43 - Dependency-Aware Resource Discovery](./43-dependency-aware-resource-discovery.md)  
**Related PRDs**: Enhances foundation built by PRD #43

## Executive Summary

While PRD #43 provides structured resource discovery and dependency awareness, users still miss optimal high-level abstractions because the AI cannot semantically match generic resource names to specific intents. This PRD implements Vector DB-based semantic matching to ensure users get the simplest possible solutions for their needs.

## Problem Statement

### Remaining Gaps After PRD #43
1. **Generic Resource Blindness**: AI doesn't recognize that `SQL (devopstoolkit.live)` handles "PostgreSQL" intent
2. **No Semantic Understanding**: Can't match user concepts to abstract resource capabilities  
3. **Missing Solution Patterns**: No learning from successful multi-resource deployments
4. **Intent Complexity Mismatch**: Users get complex solutions when simple ones exist

### Real-World Impact
- User requests "PostgreSQL database" → AI sees structured Azure resources but misses generic SQL composite
- `sqls.devopstoolkit.live` provides one-resource solution but gets buried in complex alternatives
- No learning from organizational deployment patterns and user preferences
- Suboptimal user experience despite having better tools available

## Success Criteria

### Primary Goals
- **Semantic Intent Matching**: "PostgreSQL" intent finds `sqls.devopstoolkit.live` as top candidate
- **Abstraction Prioritization**: Composite resources ranked above complex multi-resource solutions
- **Pattern Learning**: System learns from successful deployments and user choices
- **Context Awareness**: Multi-cloud resources understood for their capabilities

### Success Metrics
- Generic composite resources (SQL, App) appear in relevant recommendations
- User satisfaction with solution simplicity increases
- Reduced average deployment complexity for standard use cases
- Improved semantic match accuracy for domain-specific resources

## Solution Architecture

### Vector Database Enhancement Layer

Builds on PRD #43's structured discovery to add semantic intelligence:

```typescript
// PRD #43 provides structured solutions
const structuredSolutions = await dependencyAwareDiscovery(intent);

// This PRD adds semantic ranking
const semanticRanking = await vectorDB.rankBySemantic(intent, structuredSolutions);
const finalRanking = combineStructuralAndSemantic(structuredSolutions, semanticRanking);
```

### Semantic Knowledge Sources

#### 1. Resource Capability Mapping
Store enhanced metadata about resource capabilities:

```json
{
  "resource": "SQL (devopstoolkit.live/v1beta1)",
  "capabilities": ["postgresql", "mysql", "database", "multi-cloud"],
  "providers": ["azure", "gcp", "aws"],
  "abstractions": ["high-availability", "persistent-storage", "backup"],
  "complexity": "low"
}
```

#### 2. Intent Pattern Learning
Learn from successful user choices and deployment patterns:

```json
{
  "intent_pattern": "postgresql + azure + high-availability", 
  "successful_solutions": [
    {
      "solution": "SQL (devopstoolkit.live)",
      "user_satisfaction": 0.95,
      "deployment_success": 0.98
    },
    {
      "solution": "ResourceGroup + Server + FirewallRule", 
      "user_satisfaction": 0.75,
      "deployment_success": 0.90
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 3. Cross-Domain Knowledge
Store domain-specific relationships and requirements:

```json
{
  "domain": "azure-databases",
  "requirements": {
    "foundation": ["ResourceGroup"],
    "security": ["FirewallRule"], 
    "alternatives": {
      "simple": ["SQL (devopstoolkit.live)"],
      "detailed": ["Server + Database + User"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Vector Database Schema

#### Resource Embedding Store
- **Resource vectors**: Semantic embeddings of resource capabilities
- **Intent vectors**: User intent embeddings for similarity matching
- **Solution patterns**: Multi-resource solution embeddings

#### Knowledge Enhancement Pipeline
```typescript
// 1. Extract semantic features from structured solutions (PRD #43)
const solutions = await structuredDiscovery.getSolutions(intent);

// 2. Generate embeddings for semantic matching
const embeddings = await generateEmbeddings(solutions, intent);

// 3. Semantic similarity scoring
const semanticScores = await vectorDB.similarity(intentEmbedding, resourceEmbeddings);

// 4. Combined ranking (structural + semantic)
const finalRanking = combineScores(structuralScores, semanticScores);
```

### Integration with PRD #43

#### Enhanced Solution Ranking
Combines structural completeness (PRD #43) with semantic relevance:

```typescript
const finalScore = (structuralScore * 0.6) + (semanticScore * 0.4);
```

#### Fallback Strategy
- Primary: Semantic-enhanced recommendations
- Fallback: PRD #43 structured solutions (if Vector DB unavailable)
- Ultimate fallback: Current system (if both enhancements fail)

- **Caching Strategy**: Cache frequent intent-resource matches for performance

## Dependencies and Assumptions

## Appendix

### Example: Enhanced PostgreSQL Discovery Flow

**After PRD #43 (Structural):**
```
Intent: "PostgreSQL on Azure"
→ Structured solutions: 
  1. [ResourceGroup, Server, FirewallRule] (score: 85)
  2. [StatefulSet, ConfigMap, Secret] (score: 60)
→ Missing: sqls.devopstoolkit.live (generic name doesn't match)
```

**After PRD #44 (Semantic Enhancement):**
```
Intent: "PostgreSQL on Azure" 
→ Semantic matching: sqls.devopstoolkit.live matches "postgresql" + "azure"
→ Enhanced ranking:
  1. SQL (devopstoolkit.live) (combined score: 95)
  2. [ResourceGroup, Server, FirewallRule] (combined score: 85)  
  3. [StatefulSet, ConfigMap, Secret] (combined score: 60)
```

### Vector DB Integration Points
- **Resource Enhancement**: Add semantic metadata to structured solutions from PRD #43
- **Intent Analysis**: Understand multi-concept user intents (cloud + database + requirements)  
- **Pattern Learning**: Store successful solution patterns for future recommendations
- **Feedback Loop**: Learn from user choices to improve semantic matching accuracy
