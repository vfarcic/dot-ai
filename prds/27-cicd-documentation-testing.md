# PRD: CI/CD Pipeline Integration for Documentation Testing

**Created**: 2025-07-22
**Status**: Draft
**Owner**: Viktor Farcic
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-22

## Executive Summary
Integrate the existing comprehensive documentation testing system (PRD #12) with CI/CD pipelines to enable automated validation of documentation on every code change, preventing documentation drift and ensuring examples remain current.

## Problem Statement
The documentation testing system is 95% complete with robust testing capabilities, but it requires manual execution which limits adoption by development teams. Without automated integration:
- Documentation drift occurs as code changes but docs aren't validated
- Broken examples and outdated instructions reach users
- Teams don't adopt documentation testing due to manual overhead
- Quality gates for documentation don't exist in development workflows

This prevents achieving the original system's success criteria of "regular usage by documentation maintainers and development teams."

## Proposed Solution
Extend the existing documentation testing system with CI/CD-friendly capabilities:
- **Automated execution** in CI/CD pipelines triggered by code/doc changes
- **Structured reporting** with pass/fail status and detailed results
- **Integration templates** for popular CI/CD platforms (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
- **Quality gates** that can fail builds when documentation issues are found
- **Result artifacts** for review and debugging

## User Stories & Use Cases
- As a **development team**, I want documentation to be automatically validated on every PR so that broken examples are caught before merging
- As a **DevOps engineer**, I want to add documentation quality gates to our CI/CD pipeline so that we can prevent releases with outdated docs
- As a **technical writer**, I want to receive automated feedback on documentation changes so that I can fix issues before they reach users
- As a **project maintainer**, I want contributors' documentation to be automatically validated so that PRs don't introduce broken examples
- As a **team lead**, I want documentation testing results in our CI dashboard so that we can track documentation quality over time

## Requirements Tracking

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **CI/CD execution mode** - Run documentation testing in automated environments without interactive prompts
- [ ] **Structured exit codes** - Return appropriate exit codes for CI/CD success/failure handling
- [ ] **Machine-readable output** - Generate JSON/XML reports consumable by CI/CD systems
- [ ] **Selective testing** - Test only changed files or specific patterns to optimize CI/CD performance
- [ ] **Configuration file support** - Allow teams to configure testing behavior via config files
