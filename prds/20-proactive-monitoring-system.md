# PRD: Proactive In-Cluster Monitoring System

**Created**: 2025-07-28
**Status**: Draft
**Owner**: Viktor Farcic
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-28

## Executive Summary
Build proactive monitoring system with health checks, alerting, anomaly detection, and automated remediation for deployed applications beyond on-demand status queries.

## Documentation Changes

### Files Created/Updated
- **`docs/proactive-monitoring-guide.md`** - New File - Complete guide for continuous monitoring and alerting
- **`docs/alerting-configuration-guide.md`** - New File - Alert setup and notification configuration
- **`docs/mcp-guide.md`** - MCP Documentation - Add monitoring setup and management MCP tools
- **`README.md`** - Project Overview - Add proactive monitoring to operational capabilities
- **`src/core/monitoring/`** - Technical Implementation - Proactive monitoring system modules

### User Journey Validation
- [ ] **Primary workflow** documented end-to-end: Deploy app → Enable monitoring → Receive alerts → Auto-remediation
- [ ] **Secondary workflows** have complete coverage: Alert configuration, anomaly detection, monitoring management
- [ ] **Cross-references** between on-demand monitoring (PRD #3) and proactive monitoring work correctly

## Implementation Requirements
- [ ] **Core functionality**: Continuous monitoring with health checks and alerting
- [ ] **User workflows**: Proactive issue detection and automated remediation
- [ ] **Performance optimization**: Efficient monitoring with minimal cluster resource impact

## Work Log
### 2025-07-28: PRD Refactoring to Documentation-First Format
**Completed Work**: Refactored PRD #20 to follow new documentation-first guidelines with comprehensive proactive monitoring features.
