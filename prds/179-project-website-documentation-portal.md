# PRD: Project Website with Documentation Portal

**GitHub Issue**: [#179](https://github.com/vfarcic/dot-ai/issues/179)

## Overview

### Problem Statement
The DevOps AI Toolkit currently lacks a dedicated website to showcase the tool and provide accessible documentation for end users. Documentation is scattered in the repository without a user-friendly interface, making it difficult for potential users to discover features, understand capabilities, and get started with the tool. This creates barriers to adoption and limits the project's reach.

### Solution Summary
Create a single-page website with an integrated documentation portal that:
- Showcases the project with a compelling landing page
- Provides user-friendly access to all existing documentation
- Leverages existing docs in the repository with minimal changes
- Keeps documentation source files in this repo alongside the website code
- Follows CNCF project standards and best practices
- Is easy to maintain and update as the project evolves

### Target Users
- **Primary**: End users evaluating or adopting the DevOps AI Toolkit
- **Secondary**: Contributors looking to understand the project
- **Tertiary**: CNCF reviewers and open source community members

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Professional, single-page website live and publicly accessible
- [ ] All existing documentation integrated and easily navigable
- [ ] Documentation remains in repository (not external platform)
- [ ] Website follows CNCF project standards
- [ ] Clear getting started path for new users
- [ ] Fast load times and good SEO
- [ ] Easy for maintainers to update content
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design

## User Experience

## Technical Approach

### Design Principles
1. **Simplicity First**: Start with single-page design, expand as needed
2. **Documentation-Centric**: Docs are primary content, easily accessible
3. **Minimal Disruption**: Use existing docs with minimal changes
4. **Repository-Based**: All content lives in this repo for version control
5. **Static Generation**: Fast, secure, easy to host
6. **Maintainability**: Easy for team to update without specialized knowledge
7. **Standards Compliance**: Follow CNCF and open source best practices

### Technology Considerations (To Be Decided)
Options to evaluate during implementation:
- **Docusaurus**: React-based, popular in CNCF projects
- **VitePress**: Vue-based, fast, good for single-page sites
- **MkDocs Material**: Python-based, excellent docs focus
- **Hugo**: Go-based, extremely fast, flexible

Evaluation criteria:
- Ease of integrating existing markdown docs
- Single-page site support
- CNCF project usage/examples
- Build performance
- Maintenance overhead
- Community support

### Content Strategy
1. **Existing Documentation**: Audit current docs in repo
2. **Minimal Changes**: Preserve content, adjust formatting only if needed
3. **Navigation Structure**: Create logical hierarchy for docs
4. **Homepage Content**: Write compelling project description
5. **SEO Optimization**: Metadata, descriptions, keywords
6. **Search Functionality**: Enable doc search for user convenience

### Hosting & Deployment
- **GitHub Pages** (default option) or **Netlify/Vercel**
- Automated deployment on push to main branch
- Custom domain if available (e.g., devops-ai-toolkit.io)
- HTTPS enabled
- CDN for global performance

|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Documentation requires significant restructuring | High | Medium | Thorough audit in Milestone 1; choose flexible static site generator |
| Technology choice doesn't meet needs | High | Low | Evaluate multiple options against clear criteria; prototype before committing |
| Poor performance or SEO | Medium | Low | Use proven static site generators; follow web performance best practices |
| Difficult for team to maintain | Medium | Medium | Choose technology familiar to team; extensive documentation in Milestone 7 |
| Hosting costs or limitations | Low | Low | Start with free GitHub Pages; evaluate alternatives if needed |
| Content becomes outdated | Medium | High | Document clear maintenance process; integrate with development workflow |

## Open Questions

1. **Domain Name**: Do we want a custom domain? If so, what domain and who manages it?
2. **Analytics**: Should we include website analytics? What privacy considerations?
3. **Internationalization**: English only for now, or plan for i18n?
4. **Community Features**: Should we integrate GitHub Discussions, Slack, or other community tools?
5. **Versioned Docs**: Do we need documentation versioning for different releases?
6. **API Documentation**: Should API docs be auto-generated from code or manually maintained?
7. **Examples Repository**: Should examples live in separate repo or integrated in main repo?
