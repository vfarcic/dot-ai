# PRD: Integration Testing Framework for DevOps AI Toolkit

**Issue**: #111
**Created**: 2025-01-19
**Completed**: 2025-09-30
**Status**: Complete
**Priority**: Medium
**Owner**: Claude Code  

## Executive Summary

Build a comprehensive integration testing framework that validates all dot-ai tools work correctly with real Kubernetes clusters and external dependencies. This framework leverages the REST API gateway to provide simple HTTP-based testing that can run in CI/CD pipelines and local development environments.

**Key Strategy**: Replace all unit tests with integration tests. The end goal is zero unit tests, as dot-ai's value lies entirely in integrating Kubernetes, AI, and databases - testing these in isolation with mocks provides false confidence.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
- Testing relies primarily on unit tests with mocked dependencies
- No validation that tools work correctly with real Kubernetes clusters
- Difficult to test complex scenarios involving multiple tools and dependencies
- Manual testing required for each release to verify functionality
- No automated regression testing for tool integrations
- Integration issues discovered late in development cycle

### User Impact
- **Development Teams**: Risk of shipping bugs that only appear in real environments
- **QA Teams**: Manual testing burden for complex integration scenarios
- **Platform Teams**: Lack of confidence in tool reliability for production use
- **Contributors**: Difficulty testing changes without complex local setup

## Success Criteria

- All dot-ai tools have comprehensive integration tests
- **All unit tests eliminated** (phased removal as integration tests prove coverage)
- Tests run automatically in CI/CD pipeline
- Test suite covers real Kubernetes cluster interactions
- Failed tests provide actionable debugging information
- Test execution time under 15 minutes for full suite
- Easy to add tests for new tools without framework changes
- Tests are self-documenting using BDD-style scenario descriptions
- Integration tests use real AI (Claude Haiku) for realistic validation
- Zero mock maintenance burden

## Scope

### In Scope
- HTTP-based integration tests using REST API gateway
- Real Kubernetes cluster integration (test clusters)
- Test data management and cleanup
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Test reporting and failure analysis
- Coverage tracking for tool functionality
- Local development testing support

### Out of Scope
- Performance/load testing (separate initiative)
- Security penetration testing (separate security initiative)
- Multi-cluster testing scenarios (single cluster focus)
- Production environment testing (test clusters only)
- Maintaining unit tests (will be eliminated entirely)
- TestDocs tool integration testing (deferred - not critical for core deployment/remediation workflows)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Tool Test Coverage**
   - Integration tests for all existing tools (recommend, remediate, deploy, etc.)
   - Tests cover primary use cases and error scenarios
   - Validation of tool outputs and side effects
   - Cross-tool interaction testing where applicable

2. **Kubernetes Integration**
   - Tests run against real Kubernetes clusters
   - Automatic test cluster setup and teardown
   - Test namespace isolation and cleanup
   - Kubernetes resource lifecycle testing

3. **Test Data Management**
   - Reusable test fixtures and scenarios
   - **Namespace-based isolation**: Each test creates unique namespace
   - **Simple cleanup**: Delete namespace cascades to all resources
   - **No resource tracking needed**: Namespace deletion handles everything
   - Test data versioning and consistency
   - Parameterized tests for different configurations

4. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Tests run on every pull request
   - Clear pass/fail reporting
   - Integration with existing GitHub Actions
   - Test results available in PR status checks

5. **Local Development**
   - Easy test execution for developers
   - **Selective test execution** (single file, test suite, or pattern matching)
   - Fast feedback loop for test failures (15-30s for single test)
   - Persistent cluster option for rapid iteration
   - Minimal setup requirements
   - Clear documentation for running tests

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Full test suite completes within 15 minutes (3-5 minutes with parallelism)
- **Individual Test Performance**: Complex workflow tests complete within 10-15 seconds
- **Development Iteration**: Single test execution in 15-30 seconds with persistent cluster
- **Parallel Execution**: Support 10-20 concurrent test workers
- **Reliability**: Tests pass consistently with <1% flake rate
- **Maintainability**: New tools automatically included in test framework
- **Resource Management**: Namespace-based cleanup with async deletion (no waiting)
- **Isolation**: Each test runs in unique namespace, perfect isolation
- **Debuggability**: Clear error messages and logs for test failures
- **Readability**: Tests organized by user scenarios, not technical implementation
- **Simplicity**: No resource tracking, namespace deletion handles all cleanup

## Technical Design

### Architecture Overview

```
GitHub Actions → Test Runner → REST API Gateway → dot-ai Tools → Test Kubernetes Cluster
                      ↓              ↓                ↓                    ↓
                Test Reports ← Result Validation ← Tool Responses ← Cluster State
                                                         ↓
                                                  Claude Haiku API
                                                  (Test AI Model)
```

### Design Decisions

#### AI Strategy for Testing
- **Decision**: Use Claude 3 Haiku for all integration tests
- **Model**: `claude-3-haiku-20240307`
- **Rationale**:
  - 2-3x faster than production Sonnet model (0.8-2.5s vs 2-5s)
  - 12x cheaper ($0.25/$1.25 per 1M tokens vs $3/$15)
  - Same Anthropic SDK - no code changes needed
  - Provides real AI behavior validation
- **Configuration**:
  ```typescript
  const testAI = new Anthropic({
    apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY  // Same key for all models
  });
  const response = await testAI.messages.create({
    model: process.env.CLAUDE_MODEL || 'claude-3-haiku-20240307',
    max_tokens: 2048,
    temperature: 0  // Maximum determinism
  });
  ```

#### Model Configuration Implementation
- **Approach**: Environment variable based model switching
- **Implementation**:
  ```typescript
  // src/core/claude.ts - Single line change needed
  const stream = await this.client.messages.create({
    model: process.env.CLAUDE_MODEL || 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022',
    // ... rest of configuration
  });
  ```
- **Test Setup**:
  ```bash
  # .env.test or test setup
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-xxxxx  # Same key as production
  CLAUDE_MODEL=claude-3-haiku-20240307   # Override model for tests
  ```

#### Test Organization Strategy
- **Decision**: BDD-style scenario-based test organization
- **Rationale**: Tests serve as living documentation
- **Structure**:
  - Tests grouped by user scenarios (`scenarios/`)
  - User journey tests (`journeys/`)
  - Named by business value, not technical implementation
  - Example: `crashloop-remediation.scenario.test.ts`

#### Infrastructure Approach
- **Decision**: Use real Kubernetes test clusters with pre-built Kind images
- **Implementation**: Custom Kind node images with pre-installed operators
- **Rationale**:
  - Mocking would create unrealistic tests
  - Pre-built images enable fast cluster creation (~10s)
  - Guarantees clean state for each test run
  - No complex cleanup logic needed
- **Real Operations Include**:
  - `kubectl api-resources` (~0.5-2s)
  - `kubectl get crd` (~0.5-1s)
  - Resource discovery and deployment
  - Actual cluster state validation

#### Test Cluster Strategy
- **Hybrid Approach**:
  - **Development**: Persistent cluster with resource cleanup after each test
  - **CI/CD**: Fresh cluster per test run using pre-built images
- **Development Lifecycle**: Create Once → Run Many Tests (with cleanup) → Manual Destroy
- **CI/CD Lifecycle**: Create → Run Tests → Destroy
- **Image Contents**:
  - Base: `kindest/node:v1.29.0`
  - Pre-installed: CloudNativePG operator
  - Pre-pulled: Common container images
- **Cluster Configuration for Parallel Tests**:
  - Increased pod limits (200 pods)
  - Higher connection limits
  - Tuned resource quotas
- **Benefits**:
  - Development: Fast iteration without repeated cluster creation
  - CI/CD: Clean, reproducible environment
  - Both: Guaranteed clean state between tests

### Core Components

1. **Test Framework** (`tests/integration/`)
   - HTTP client for REST API gateway
   - Kubernetes client for cluster validation
   - Test utilities and helpers
   - Assertion and validation libraries

2. **Test Suites**
   - **Scenario Tests** (`tests/integration/scenarios/`)
     - Real-world problem scenarios
     - Example: `crashloop-remediation.scenario.test.ts`
   - **Journey Tests** (`tests/integration/journeys/`)
     - End-to-end user workflows
     - Example: `deploy-application.journey.test.ts`
   - **Tool Tests** (`tests/integration/tools/`)
     - Individual tool validation
     - Error cases and edge conditions

3. **Test Infrastructure** (`tests/integration/infrastructure/`)
   - Pre-built Kind image configuration
   - Cluster creation/destruction scripts
   - Operator pre-installation manifests
   - Test data fixtures
   - Image build automation
   - Namespace management utilities

4. **Test Helpers** (`tests/integration/helpers/`)
   - **IntegrationTest base class**: Handles namespace lifecycle
   - **Common assertions**: `expectPodRunning`, `expectServiceReachable`
   - **Resource builders**: For complex but common resources
   - **Scenario builders**: Reusable test scenarios
   - Balance: Keep test logic visible, extract infrastructure only

5. **CI/CD Integration** (`.github/workflows/`)
   - Integration test workflow with parallel execution
   - Test cluster provisioning with resource tuning
   - Test result reporting and timing metrics
   - Artifact collection and storage
   - Parallel test configuration

### Test Execution Flow

1. **Setup Phase**
   - Create Kind cluster from pre-built image (~10s)
   - Verify pre-installed operators (CNPG)
   - Deploy dot-ai with REST API gateway
   - Cluster ready with all dependencies

2. **Test Execution**
   - **Each test creates unique namespace** (test-{workerId}-{name}-{timestamp})
   - All resources created within test namespace
   - Run tool-specific integration tests
   - Validate responses and cluster state
   - Execute cross-tool scenarios
   - Collect logs and artifacts

3. **Cleanup Phase**
   - **All Modes**:
     - Delete test namespace with `--wait=false` (returns immediately)
     - Deletion happens asynchronously in background
     - No individual resource cleanup needed
     - Next test can start while previous namespace deletes
   - **Development Mode**:
     - Cluster persists for next test run
   - **CI/CD Mode**:
     - Destroy entire Kind cluster after all tests

### Example Test Structure

```typescript
// tests/integration/scenarios/crashloop-remediation.scenario.test.ts
import { IntegrationTest } from '../helpers/test-base';

describe('Scenario: Pod CrashLoopBackOff Remediation', () => {
  const test = new IntegrationTest();

  // No namespace boilerplate - handled by base class
  beforeEach(() => test.setup('crashloop'));
  afterEach(() => test.cleanup()); // Returns immediately, deletion in background

  const scenario = {
    problem: 'Application pod stuck in CrashLoopBackOff due to missing ConfigMap',
    expectedFix: 'Create missing ConfigMap with required configuration',
    verifyFix: 'Pod transitions to Running state'
  };

  test(`
    Problem:      ${scenario.problem}
    Expected Fix: ${scenario.expectedFix}
    Verification: ${scenario.verifyFix}
  `, async () => {
    // GIVEN: A pod with missing ConfigMap dependency
    // Base class handles namespace automatically
    await test.createPodWithMissingConfigMap('test-app');
    await test.waitForCondition('pod/test-app', 'CrashLoopBackOff');

    // WHEN: We request AI-powered remediation (using Claude Haiku)
    const result = await callTool('/api/v1/tools/remediate', {
      issue: 'Pod test-app is in CrashLoopBackOff',
      mode: 'automatic'
    });

    // THEN: The AI identifies and fixes the root cause
    expect(result.rootCause).toContain('missing ConfigMap');
    expect(result.actions).toInclude('Created ConfigMap: test-app-config');

    // AND: The pod recovers to Running state
    await expectPodRunning('test-app', test.namespace);
  });
});

// tests/integration/journeys/deploy-application.journey.test.ts
import { IntegrationTest } from '../helpers/test-base';
import { expectPodsRunning, expectServiceReachable } from '../helpers/assertions';

describe('User Journey: Deploy Complete Application Stack', () => {
  const test = new IntegrationTest();

  beforeEach(() => test.setup('journey'));
  afterEach(() => test.cleanup());

  test('Step-by-step deployment from intent to running pods', async () => {
    // Test logic remains clear and visible
    const journey = await startUserJourney({ namespace: test.namespace });

    await journey.step('1. Express deployment intent', async () => {
      const recommendations = await getRecommendations('deploy nodejs API with postgres');
      expect(recommendations).toHaveMultipleSolutions();
    });

    await journey.step('2. Configure application', async () => {
      await answerQuestions({ appName: 'my-api', replicas: 3 });
    });

    await journey.step('3. Generate and deploy manifests', async () => {
      const manifests = await generateManifests();  // Uses Claude Haiku
      const deployment = await deployManifests(testNamespace);  // Deploy to test namespace
      expect(deployment.status).toBe('success');
    });

    await journey.step('4. Verify application running', async () => {
      // Reusable assertions but clear intent
      await expectPodsRunning('my-api', test.namespace, { count: 3 });
      await expectServiceReachable('my-api', test.namespace);
    });
  });
});
```

## Unit Test Elimination Plan

### Phased Removal Strategy
As integration tests are validated for each component, corresponding unit tests will be deleted:

#### Phase 1: Tool Tests (9 files)
- Write integration tests for all tools (recommend, remediate, etc.)
- Validate: Each tool has 3+ integration tests covering main scenarios
- Delete: All tests/tools/*.test.ts files

#### Phase 2: Core Tests (20+ files)
- Write integration tests for core functionality
- Validate: Real K8s, AI, and vector DB operations tested
- Delete: All tests/core/*.test.ts files

#### Phase 3: Interface Tests (2 files)
- Write REST API and MCP integration tests
- Validate: Real protocol interactions tested
- Delete: All tests/interfaces/*.test.ts files

#### Phase 4: Final Cleanup
- Delete: tests/setup.ts, tests/__mocks__/, unit test configurations
- Update: Remove jest.config.js completely, update package.json to remove unit test references
- **End State**: Zero unit tests, only integration tests remain

### Deletion Criteria
Unit tests can be deleted when integration tests demonstrate:
- Real service interactions work correctly
- Error handling with actual failures
- All critical paths covered
- No unique logic requiring isolation

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Test cluster provisioning complexity | Low | Low | Pre-built Kind images reduce complexity to single command |
| Test flakiness due to timing issues | Medium | High | Robust retry logic, proper wait conditions, isolated test environments |
| CI/CD pipeline performance issues | Medium | Medium | Parallel test execution, test result caching, incremental testing |
| Test maintenance overhead | Medium | Medium | Auto-generated test scaffolding, clear test patterns, good documentation |
| AI response variability | Low | Medium | Use temperature=0 for determinism, validate response structure not exact content |
| API cost overruns | Low | Low | Claude Haiku is 12x cheaper than production model, monitor usage |

## Dependencies

- **REST API Gateway (#110)**: Required for HTTP-based tool testing
- **Kubernetes cluster access**: Test cluster for integration testing
- **CI/CD infrastructure**: GitHub Actions for automated test execution
- **Existing tool functionality**: Tools must work correctly to test them

## Testing Philosophy

### Why Zero Unit Tests?

1. **dot-ai IS integration**: The system's value is orchestrating K8s + AI + Vector DB
2. **Mocks lie**: Mocked Kubernetes/AI behavior doesn't match reality
3. **Maintenance burden**: 300+ mock assertions require constant updates
4. **False confidence**: Unit tests with mocks prove nothing about actual behavior
5. **Better ROI**: One good integration test replaces 10 mock-heavy unit tests

### Namespace-Based Test Isolation

**Core Principle**: Every test creates its own namespace and only creates resources within that namespace.

**Benefits**:
- **Simple cleanup**: `kubectl delete namespace test-xyz --wait=false` (async, no blocking)
- **Perfect isolation**: Tests can run in parallel without conflicts
- **No tracking needed**: Namespace deletion cascades to all resources
- **Foolproof**: Cannot forget to clean resources

**Rules**:
- Never create cluster-scoped resources in tests
- Each test gets unique namespace (test-{workerId}-{name}-{timestamp})
- Cleanup is just namespace deletion
- **CRITICAL**: Always use `--wait=false` for namespace deletion
- Deletion happens asynchronously (30-60s in background)
- Next test starts immediately while previous cleans up

### Test Code Reusability

**Principle**: Balance DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) with test readability.

**CRITICAL Test Development Rule**: Always inspect actual API responses before writing assertions.

**Comprehensive Response Validation Pattern**: Every integration test should validate the complete API response structure, not just select fields.

**Standard Test Pattern**:
```typescript
test('should return comprehensive response with correct structure', async () => {
  // Define complete expected response structure based on actual API inspection
  const expectedResponse = {
    success: true,
    data: {
      tool: 'toolName',
      executionTime: expect.any(Number),
      result: {
        // Complete structure validation - include ALL fields from actual response
        status: 'success',
        system: {
          // Every field that exists in actual response
          version: { version: packageJson.version, /* ... all version fields */ },
          vectorDB: { /* complete vectorDB structure */ },
          embedding: { /* complete embedding structure */ },
          // ... ALL system fields
        },
        summary: {
          // Every field that exists in actual response
          overall: 'healthy',
          // ... ALL summary fields
        }
      }
    },
    meta: {
      timestamp: expect.stringMatching(/ISO_REGEX/),
      requestId: expect.stringMatching(/REQUEST_ID_REGEX/),
      version: 'v1'
    }
  };

  const response = await httpClient.post('/api/v1/tools/toolName', {});

  // Single comprehensive assertion - validates ENTIRE response structure
  expect(response).toMatchObject(expectedResponse);

  // No additional redundant assertions needed
});
```

**Why This Pattern**:
- **Complete Coverage**: Catches regressions in any part of the response
- **No False Passing**: Can't accidentally miss validation of new fields
- **Clean Code**: Single assertion, no duplication
- **Future-Proof**: New response fields require explicit test updates
- **Self-Documenting**: Test shows exact expected API contract

**Test-First Development Process**:
1. **Inspect API Response**: Call the actual REST API endpoint and examine the response structure
2. **Document Complete Format**: Map every field, nested object, and array in the response
3. **Write Complete Validation**: Create assertions covering the entire response structure
4. **Use Specific Values**: Use actual expected values (not `expect.any()`) where values should be deterministic
5. **Use Patterns**: Use regex patterns for variable values (timestamps, IDs, versions)
6. **Verify Edge Cases**: Test different scenarios (success, error, empty data) to see response variations

**Example Process**:
```bash
# 1. First, manually call the API to see actual response
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/tools/version

# 2. Examine the response structure:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "result": {
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "{\"status\":\"success\",\"system\":{...}}"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}

# 3. Write assertions based on actual structure, not assumptions
expect(response.data.result.content[0].text).toBeDefined();
```

**Why This Matters**:
- **Avoids brittle tests**: Tests fail when assumptions about API structure are wrong
- **Faster development**: No debugging test failures due to incorrect assertions
- **Better test quality**: Tests validate actual behavior, not imagined behavior
- **Documentation value**: Tests serve as accurate API usage examples

**IntegrationTest Base Class**:
```typescript
class IntegrationTest {
  protected namespace: string;

  async setup(name?: string): Promise<void> {
    // Auto-generates unique namespace
    // Handles kubectl create namespace
  }

  async cleanup(): Promise<void> {
    // Fires deletion and returns immediately
    await kubectl(`delete namespace ${this.namespace} --wait=false`);
    // Does NOT wait for deletion to complete
  }

  // Convenience methods that include namespace
  async createPod(name: string, spec: any);
  async waitForCondition(resource: string, condition: string);
}
```

**What to Extract**:
- ✅ Namespace lifecycle (always the same)
- ✅ Common assertions (expectPodRunning, expectServiceReachable)
- ✅ Resource builders for complex but common patterns
- ✅ Wait conditions and retry logic

**What to Keep Visible**:
- ❌ Test-specific business logic
- ❌ Simple kubectl calls (one-liners)
- ❌ Unique test scenarios
- ❌ Test flow and intent

**Result**: Infrastructure is reusable, test logic remains clear and readable.

### Async Namespace Deletion

**Critical Performance Optimization**: Namespace deletion can take 30-60+ seconds but tests don't need to wait.

```typescript
// ALWAYS use --wait=false
afterEach(async () => {
  await kubectl(`delete namespace ${namespace} --wait=false`);
  // Returns immediately, deletion happens in background
  // Next test can start while this namespace is still deleting
});
```

**Benefits**:
- Tests don't block on cleanup (saves 30-60s per test)
- Kubernetes handles deletion in background
- Unique namespaces prevent conflicts even if deletion is slow
- Massive performance improvement for test suite

**Never do this**:
```typescript
// DON'T wait for deletion - blocks unnecessarily
await kubectl(`delete namespace ${namespace}`); // ❌ Can block 30-60s
await kubectl(`delete namespace ${namespace} --wait`); // ❌ Same problem
```

### Parallel Test Execution

**Strategy**: Leverage namespace isolation to run tests in parallel for 10-20x speedup.

**Implementation Levels**:
1. **Conservative** (5 workers): Safe for resource-constrained environments
2. **Standard** (10 workers): Default for most development and CI
3. **Aggressive** (20 workers): For powerful clusters and quick feedback
4. **Maximum** (50% CPU cores): For local development with good hardware

**Resource Considerations**:
- **Cluster**: Configure Kind with increased limits (200 pods, higher connections)
- **API Rate Limits**: Claude Haiku supports ~10 concurrent requests
- **Database**: CNPG may need connection pool tuning
- **Memory**: Each test namespace consumes ~50-100MB

**Configuration**:
```javascript
// vitest.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    maxConcurrency: process.env.CI ? 10 : 5  // More parallelism in CI
  }
});
```

**Benefits**:
- Test suite completes in 3-5 minutes instead of 30-60 minutes
- Faster CI/CD feedback loops
- Proves true test isolation
- Better resource utilization

### Integration-Only Benefits

- **Real behavior validation**: Tests prove the system actually works
- **No mock drift**: No divergence between mocks and reality
- **Clearer value**: Each test demonstrates actual functionality
- **Simpler mental model**: "Does it work?" not "Is it mocked correctly?"
- **Focus**: All effort on tests that matter

## Future Enhancements

1. **Performance Testing**: Load and stress testing for tools
2. **Multi-cluster Testing**: Cross-cluster scenarios and federation
3. **Chaos Testing**: Tool behavior under failure conditions
4. **Security Testing**: Authorization and data validation testing
5. **Visual Testing**: UI testing for dashboard/web components
6. **Contract Testing**: API contract validation between versions

## Resolved Decisions

1. **AI Model Strategy** (2025-01-28)
   - **Decision**: Use Claude 3 Haiku for all integration tests
   - **Rationale**: Balances real AI behavior with speed and cost
   - **Alternative Considered**: Mock AI server (rejected due to lack of realism)

2. **Test Organization** (2025-01-28)
   - **Decision**: BDD-style scenario-based organization
   - **Rationale**: Tests serve as living documentation
   - **Impact**: Tests organized by business value, not technical implementation

3. **Infrastructure Approach** (2025-01-28)
   - **Decision**: Use real Kubernetes clusters with actual kubectl operations
   - **Rationale**: Mocking all operations would create unrealistic tests
   - **Trade-off**: Slower tests (10-15s) but real validation

4. **Model Configuration Method** (2025-01-28)
   - **Decision**: Use environment variable `CLAUDE_MODEL` to switch between models
   - **Rationale**: Minimal code changes (one line), no API breaking changes
   - **Implementation**: `process.env.CLAUDE_MODEL || 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022'`

5. **API Key Management** (2025-01-28)
   - **Decision**: Use same Anthropic API key for both production and test models
   - **Rationale**: Anthropic allows all models under one key; simpler configuration
   - **Note**: Optional separate key for billing tracking, but not required

6. **Test Operator Selection** (2025-01-28)
   - **Decision**: Use CloudNativePG (CNPG) as primary test operator
   - **Rationale**: Lightweight, fast, provides database functionality for realistic testing
   - **Future**: Add more operators incrementally as test scenarios require

7. **Cluster Lifecycle Strategy** (2025-01-28)
   - **Decision**: Hybrid approach - persistent cluster for development, fresh for CI/CD
   - **Rationale**: Balances fast iteration with clean test isolation
   - **Implementation**: Pre-built Kind images + resource cleanup utilities
   - **Trade-off**: More complex but optimizes for both use cases

8. **Selective Test Execution** (2025-01-28)
   - **Decision**: Support running individual tests or test groups
   - **Rationale**: Full suite takes 5+ minutes; developers need fast feedback
   - **Implementation**: Vitest patterns, npm scripts for common scenarios
   - **Benefit**: 15-30 second feedback for single test

9. **Resource Cleanup Strategy** (2025-01-28)
   - **Decision**: Namespace-based cleanup - each test creates unique namespace
   - **Rationale**: Namespace deletion cascades to all resources automatically
   - **Implementation**: Create namespace in beforeEach, delete in afterEach
   - **Rule**: Tests only create namespaced resources, never cluster-scoped

10. **Zero Unit Tests Strategy** (2025-01-28)
   - **Decision**: Eliminate all unit tests in favor of integration tests
   - **Rationale**: dot-ai IS an integration layer; mocking removes actual value
   - **Implementation**: Phased removal as integration tests prove coverage
   - **End Goal**: Zero unit tests, zero mock maintenance
   - **Benefit**: All tests prove real system behavior

11. **Parallel Test Execution** (2025-01-28)
   - **Decision**: Run integration tests in parallel with 10-20 workers
   - **Rationale**: Namespace isolation enables safe parallel execution
   - **Implementation**: Vitest maxWorkers configuration, tuned cluster resources
   - **Expected Speedup**: 10-20x (from 30+ min to 3-5 min)
   - **Trade-off**: Higher resource usage for dramatically faster feedback

12. **TestDocs Tool Deferral** (2025-09-30)
   - **Decision**: Defer TestDocs tool integration testing indefinitely
   - **Rationale**: TestDocs is not critical for core deployment and remediation workflows; 6 completed tool test suites provide sufficient coverage for production use
   - **Impact**: Milestone 2 considered complete for practical purposes at 6/7 tools (Recommend, Remediate, ManageOrgData Patterns/Policies/Capabilities, Version)
   - **Scope Change**: Reduced Milestone 2 from 8 tools to 7 tools (excluding TestDocs and "Test data fixtures")

13. **Milestone 4 Deferral** (2025-09-30)
   - **Decision**: Defer Milestone 4 (Advanced Testing Scenarios) until after CI/CD integration
   - **Rationale**:
     - Error case coverage: Low ROI - most error handling already validated by existing 38 tests
     - Cross-tool scenarios: Value unclear without documented user workflows showing tool chaining
     - Performance baselines: Already captured implicitly (375s total, 212s longest); optimization out of scope
     - Flake detection: Reactive work - only needed when flakes actually appear (<1% target not yet hit)
     - Coverage reporting: Premature until all other milestones complete
   - **Impact**: CI/CD integration (Milestone 3) becomes last milestone to validate complete system
   - **Sequencing Change**: Milestone 1 → 2 → 6 (Production Readiness/Docs) → 5 (Unit Test Elimination) → 3 (CI/CD)
   - **Benefit**: Single comprehensive CI validation of final system vs incremental CI updates

14. **Milestone 6 Deferral** (2025-09-30)
   - **Decision**: Defer Milestone 6 (Production Readiness) as documentation already exists
   - **Rationale**:
     - Test maintenance documentation already exists in `tests/integration/CLAUDE.md` with comprehensive standards
     - Test adding guidelines already exist in `docs/integration-testing-guide.md` with complete workflow documentation
     - Performance optimization, monitoring, and release process integration belong with Milestone 3 (CI/CD)
     - No actual work remains for Milestone 6 as standalone milestone
   - **Impact**: Milestone 6 effectively complete through organic documentation during Milestones 1-2
   - **Sequencing Change**: Milestone 1 → 2 → 5 (Unit Test Elimination) → 3 (CI/CD with performance/monitoring)
   - **Benefit**: Eliminates redundant milestone, focuses effort on actual remaining work

## Open Questions

1. **Test Data Management**: How to manage large test fixtures and keep them current?
2. **Additional Operators**: Which operators to add beyond CNPG as tests evolve?
3. **Optimal Parallelism**: What's the maximum beneficial parallelism level?

### 2025-09-29: ManageOrgData Capabilities Integration Testing Complete
**Duration**: ~4 hours (estimated from commit timestamps and conversation length)
**Commits**: Multiple commits focusing on test fixes and API response alignment
**Primary Focus**: Fix failing integration tests and establish robust testing foundation for capabilities module

**Completed PRD Items**:
- [x] **ManageOrgData: Capabilities integration tests** - Evidence: 16/16 tests passing with comprehensive coverage:
  - CRUD operations (Create via scanning, Read/List, Update via workflow, Delete with verification)
  - Complete workflow testing (resource selection, specification, processing modes)
  - Error handling scenarios (invalid operations, missing parameters, not found cases)
  - Manual and automatic processing modes
  - Semantic search functionality with real vector database
  - Progress tracking for long-running operations

**Key Technical Achievements**:
- **Fixed critical race conditions**: Removed `deleteAll` operations causing parallel test failures
- **Resolved timeout limitations**: Extended timeouts from 30s to 20 minutes for long-running capability scans (some taking 8-11 minutes)
- **API response structure alignment**: Fixed all test assertions to match actual API responses instead of assumptions
- **Proper scan completion waiting**: Implemented tests that wait for `step: 'complete'` before expecting data availability
- **Clean database state**: Implemented `beforeEach` cleanup ensuring predictable test isolation
- **Parameter usage corrections**: Fixed `response` vs `resourceList` parameter usage in workflow steps

**Additional Work Done**:
- Established pattern for comprehensive API response validation using actual response inspection
- Implemented proper error handling for Kyverno resource processing issues
- Created robust test foundation that validates real capability scanning with Kubernetes clusters
- Demonstrated successful long-running scans (8-11 minutes) creating and storing capabilities in vector database

**Next Session Priorities**:
- Implement patterns integration tests (organizational patterns CRUD)
- Implement policies integration tests (policy intents CRUD)
- Set up separate Qdrant database for recommendation testing
- Apply same testing patterns to remaining tools (remediate, recommend, testDocs)

### 2025-09-29: ManageOrgData Patterns Integration Testing Complete
**Duration**: ~2 hours (estimated from continuous testing and debugging session)
**Commits**: Multiple commits with test fixes and validation improvements
**Primary Focus**: Complete patterns integration testing with comprehensive workflow validation and establish consistent testing patterns

**Completed PRD Items**:
- [x] **ManageOrgData: Patterns integration tests** - Evidence: 9/9 tests passing with comprehensive coverage:
  - Complete CREATE → GET → LIST → SEARCH → DELETE workflow in single comprehensive test
  - All 8 workflow steps tested (start → description → triggers → trigger-expansion → resources → rationale → created-by → review → complete)
  - Error handling scenarios (missing parameters, invalid operations, non-existent resources)
  - Search functionality validation with semantic search capabilities
  - Proper trigger expansion and user selection workflow validation

**Key Technical Achievements**:
- **Fixed trigger validation mismatch**: Updated test expectations from original input triggers to AI-expanded user-selected triggers (`['postgresql', 'mysql', 'statefulset', 'persistentvolume']`)
- **Resolved search response structure issues**: Updated validation to match actual API response format (`relevanceScore`, `resourcesCount`, `triggersCount`, `returnedCount`, `totalCount`)
- **Established consistent validation patterns**: All tests now use `toMatchObject` pattern with specific expected values instead of generic matchers
- **Race condition prevention**: Implemented `beforeAll` cleanup with unique test data timestamps to prevent parallel test conflicts
- **Comprehensive workflow testing**: Single test covers all major operations eliminating redundant test fragmentation

**Additional Work Done**:
- Created comprehensive integration testing guide (`tests/integration/CLAUDE.md`) documenting best practices
- Eliminated redundant tests and consolidated functionality into single comprehensive workflow test
- Fixed race conditions in capabilities tests by moving cleanup from `beforeEach` to `beforeAll`
- Updated search capabilities validation with flexible provider handling for future test environments
- Applied evidence-based testing approach using actual API response inspection

**Next Session Priorities**:
- Implement ManageOrgData policies integration tests (final ManageOrgData dataType)
- Implement recommend tool integration tests (complex multi-step workflow)
- Complete local development documentation (final Milestone 1 requirement)
- Begin CI/CD pipeline integration planning (Milestone 3)

### 2025-09-30: ManageOrgData Policies Integration Testing Complete
**Duration**: ~2 hours (estimated from conversation and implementation)
**Commits**: Multiple commits with test implementation and refinements
**Primary Focus**: Complete policy integration testing with comprehensive workflow validation and infrastructure optimization

**Completed PRD Items**:
- [x] **ManageOrgData: Policies integration tests** - Evidence: 10/10 tests passing in `tests/integration/tools/manage-org-data-policies.test.ts`

**Key Technical Achievements**:
- **Complete 7-step workflow validation**: description → triggers → trigger-expansion → rationale → created-by → namespace-scope → kyverno-generation → complete
- **Store-intent-only workflow**: Generates Kyverno policy YAML but skips cluster deployment, stores intent in Vector DB only
- **Apply-to-cluster workflow**: Complete policy creation with Kyverno ClusterPolicy deployment to cluster
- **Kyverno ClusterPolicy deployment verification**: Validates policy exists in cluster with correct labels and matches generated YAML
- **Vector DB storage validation**: Confirms policy intents stored with correct structure and searchable metadata
- **Comprehensive CRUD operations**: GET by ID, LIST all policies, SEARCH by semantic query, DELETE with confirmation
- **Error handling**: Invalid operations, missing parameters, non-existent resources, invalid session IDs

**Additional Infrastructure Work**:
- **Removed unnecessary namespace creation**: Deleted `setup()` and `cleanup()` methods from IntegrationTest base class (lines 30-87)
- **Removed namespace lifecycle hooks**: Deleted `beforeEach`/`afterEach` calls from all 4 test files (version, capabilities, patterns, policies)
- **Performance improvement**: Eliminated 2-3 seconds × 35 tests = ~70-100 seconds overhead per test run
- **Cleaner test output**: No more "failed to delete namespace" warnings in test results
- **Rationale**: Current tests don't deploy resources to namespaces; namespace utilities will be added back when needed for deploy/remediate tests

**Test Results**: 35/35 tests passing (100% pass rate)
- Version: 4/4 tests
- Capabilities: 16/16 tests
- Patterns: 9/9 tests
- Policies: 10/10 tests

**Technical Discoveries**:
- Kyverno generation happens synchronously during namespace-scope response (takes 20-30 seconds but returns directly to complete step)
- Store-intent-only choice happens at complete/review step AFTER all workflow questions and Kyverno generation
- Namespace scope is asked even for store-intent-only because workflow doesn't know user's choice until the end
- No polling needed for Kyverno generation - it completes before response is returned

**Next Session Priorities**:
- Implement Remediate tool integration tests (AI-powered issue analysis and remediation)
- Implement TestDocs tool integration tests (documentation validation workflows)
- Complete local development documentation (final Milestone 1 requirement)
- Begin CI/CD pipeline integration planning (Milestone 3)

### 2025-01-30: Recommend Tool Integration Testing Complete
**Duration**: ~4 hours
**Primary Focus**: Recommend tool workflow validation with AI-suggested answers

**Completed PRD Items**:
- [x] **Recommend tool integration tests** - Evidence: `tests/integration/tools/recommend.test.ts` with comprehensive 11-phase workflow test

**Technical Implementation Details**:
- **Complete workflow validation** (11 phases):
  1. Clarification: Vague intent → AI returns clarification questions
  2. Solutions: Refined intent → AI returns ranked deployment solutions
  3. Choose solution → Receive configuration questions with `suggestedAnswer` fields
  4. Answer required stage using AI-provided `suggestedAnswer` values
  5-7. Progress through optional stages (basic, advanced, open)
  8. Generate Kubernetes manifests from completed configuration
  9. Deploy manifests to test cluster
  10. Verify resources deployed correctly using manifest files
  11. Cleanup: Delete all deployed resources

- **Key Innovation - `suggestedAnswer` field**:
  - Updated `prompts/question-generation.md`: Added `suggestedAnswer` to AI response format with instruction to populate valid example values
  - Extended `Question` interface (`src/core/schema.ts`): Added `suggestedAnswer?: any` property
  - **Impact**: Enables automated integration testing with dynamically generated AI questions
  - **Solution to testing challenge**: Questions vary based on cluster state, resources, and AI decisions; suggested answers provide working examples

**Testing Strategy**:
- **Incremental development**: curl → inspect actual response → write test → validate
- **Evidence-based assertions**: All test expectations based on actual API responses
- **Consistent validation pattern**: Used `toMatchObject` throughout per integration testing standards
- **Generic validation**: Solution-agnostic tests work with any AI-recommended deployment approach
- **Resource verification**: Used deployed manifest files for validation and cleanup
- **Test duration**: ~4 minutes for complete end-to-end workflow

**Test Coverage**:
- Clarification workflow (vague → refined intent)
- Solution generation and ranking
- Question generation with AI-suggested answers
- Multi-stage configuration (required, basic, advanced, open)
- Manifest generation from user answers
- Kubernetes deployment execution
- Resource existence verification
- Cleanup and resource deletion

**Next Session Priorities**:
- Remediate tool integration tests
- TestDocs tool integration tests
- Consider CI/CD pipeline integration once all tool tests complete

### 2025-09-30: Remediate Tool Integration Testing Complete
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Primary Focus**: Remediate tool workflow validation with AI-powered investigation and cluster remediation

**Completed PRD Items**:
- [x] **Remediate tool integration tests** - Evidence: `tests/integration/tools/remediate.test.ts` with 2 comprehensive workflow tests

**Technical Implementation Details**:
- **Manual Mode Workflow Test** (157s execution):
  1. Setup: Create OOM pod (128Mi limit, 250M allocation request)
  2. Wait for pod to crash (30s for at least one restart)
  3. Phase 1 - AI Investigation: POST `/api/v1/tools/remediate` with issue description
     - AI performs 9 investigation iterations
     - Identifies OOM root cause with >0.8 confidence
     - Returns remediation plan with execution choices
  4. Phase 2 - Execution: POST with `executeChoice: 1` and sessionId
     - Executes remediation commands via MCP
     - Returns execution results and validation
  5. Phase 3 - Cluster Validation:
     - Verify pod status = Running
     - Verify restart count = 0 (new healthy pod)
     - Verify memory limit increased from 128Mi
     - Verify Ready condition = True

- **Automatic Mode Workflow Test** (131s execution):
  1. Setup: Same OOM pod scenario in separate namespace
  2. Single Call Auto-Execution: POST with `mode: 'automatic', confidenceThreshold: 0.8, maxRiskLevel: 'medium'`
     - AI investigates, identifies root cause, and auto-executes in one call
     - No user approval required when thresholds met
     - Returns execution results and validation
  3. Cluster Validation: Same checks as manual mode

**Testing Strategy**:
- **Incremental curl-driven development**: curl → inspect actual response → write test → validate
- **Evidence-based assertions**: All expectations based on actual API responses from test runs
- **Consistent validation pattern**: Used `toMatchObject` throughout per integration testing standards
- **Real cluster validation**: Tests verify actual cluster state changes, not just API responses
- **Namespace isolation**: Each test uses separate namespace for parallel execution safety

**Test Coverage**:
- AI investigation workflow (multi-iteration problem analysis)
- Root cause identification and confidence scoring
- Remediation plan generation with risk assessment
- Manual mode user approval workflow
- Automatic mode threshold-based execution
- Actual Kubernetes cluster remediation (pod recreation, resource limit changes)
- Post-remediation validation
- Both execution methods (MCP-based and agent-based)

**Configuration Cleanup**:
- Removed incorrect `MODEL=claude-3-haiku-20240307` references from all test files
- Tests now correctly use Sonnet model (Haiku doesn't support 64k max_tokens)
- Fixed version.test.ts by removing unnecessary namespace checks
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` to document `./tmp` usage instead of `/tmp`

**Test Results**:
- All 38 integration tests passing (6 test files)
- Total runtime: 375s with parallelization (20 workers, 5 concurrent tests per file)
- Longest test: recommend workflow (212s)
- Remediate tests: 157s (manual), 131s (automatic)

**Next Session Priorities**:
- TestDocs tool integration tests (last remaining Milestone 2 item)
- Begin Milestone 3: CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions workflow)

---

### 2025-09-30: TestDocs Tool Deferral Decision
**Duration**: N/A (strategic decision)
**Primary Focus**: Scope refinement and prioritization

**Design Decision**:
- **Decision**: Defer TestDocs tool integration testing indefinitely
- **Date**: 2025-09-30
- **Rationale**: After completing 6 critical tool test suites (Recommend, Remediate, ManageOrgData Patterns/Policies/Capabilities, Version), TestDocs is not essential for core deployment and remediation workflows that represent the primary value of dot-ai
- **Impact Assessment**:
  - **Requirements Impact**: TestDocs integration testing removed from Milestone 2 scope
  - **Scope Impact**: Milestone 2 effectively complete at 6/7 tools (86% coverage of critical functionality)
  - **Timeline Impact**: Enables progression to Milestone 3 (CI/CD Integration) without delay
  - **Risk Impact**: Low - TestDocs is auxiliary to core workflows; existing tests cover 38 test cases across critical tools

**Milestone 2 Status**: ✅ Complete for practical purposes
- 38/38 integration tests passing across 6 tool test suites
- 375s total runtime with 20-worker parallelization
- Comprehensive coverage of deployment, remediation, and organizational data management workflows

**Updated Milestone Completion Criteria**:
- Original: 8 tools (Recommend, Remediate, TestDocs, ManageOrgData×3, Version, Test fixtures)
- Revised: 6 critical tools (TestDocs and test fixtures deferred)
- Milestone 2 considered complete and ready for CI/CD integration

**Next Session Priorities**:
- ✅ **Milestone 2 Complete** - All critical tools tested
- → **Begin Milestone 3**: CI/CD Pipeline Integration (GitHub Actions workflow)
- Focus on automating the 38 passing integration tests in CI/CD

---

### 2025-09-30: Milestone 1 Complete - Local Development Documentation
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Primary Focus**: Complete local development documentation for integration testing framework

- [x] Local development documentation - Created comprehensive `docs/integration-testing-guide.md` with:
  - Prerequisites: Devbox installation, Docker Desktop, Node.js requirements, environment variables
  - Quick Start: Step-by-step cluster setup, server startup, running tests, teardown
  - Selective Test Execution: Single file, multiple files by pattern, test name patterns
  - Debugging Failed Tests: Verbosity, server logs, cluster state verification, common issues
  - Adding New Integration Tests: Test file structure, established patterns, namespace management
  - Performance Tips: Parallel execution, timeouts, fast iteration workflows

**Testing Completed**:
- Verified all documented commands work correctly:
  - `npm run test:integration:setup` - Cluster setup (~2-3 min)
  - `npm run test:integration:server` - Server startup with proper background execution
  - `npm run test:integration` - Full test suite execution
  - `npm run test:integration tests/integration/tools/version.test.ts` - Selective execution
  - `npm run test:integration:teardown` - Clean teardown

**Documentation Decisions**:
- Removed watch mode from docs (exists but impractical for long-running integration tests)
- Documented Devbox shell as primary environment setup method
- Clarified Docker Desktop and Node.js as system-level prerequisites
- Organized documentation with teardown at the end after all usage instructions

**Milestone 1 Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
- All 12 items complete (11 implemented, 1 deferred)
- Integration testing framework fully operational locally
- Comprehensive documentation enables team contribution

**Next Session Priorities**:
- Begin Milestone 6: Production Readiness (test maintenance documentation, adding guidelines)
- Or Milestone 5: Unit Test Elimination (phased removal as integration coverage proves sufficient)
- Final: Milestone 3: CI/CD Integration (validate complete system in automation)

---

### 2025-09-30: Milestone 6 Deferral Decision
**Duration**: N/A (strategic review)
**Primary Focus**: Milestone prioritization and scope assessment

**Design Decision**:
- **Decision**: Defer Milestone 6 (Production Readiness) as documentation work already complete
- **Date**: 2025-09-30
- **Rationale**: Strategic review revealed that Milestone 6 deliverables already exist or belong with CI/CD:
  - Test maintenance documentation exists in `tests/integration/CLAUDE.md` (comprehensive testing standards)
  - Test adding guidelines exist in `docs/integration-testing-guide.md` (complete setup and usage guide)
  - Performance optimization belongs with Milestone 3 CI/CD implementation
  - Monitoring/alerting belongs with Milestone 3 CI/CD implementation
  - Release process integration belongs with Milestone 3 CI/CD implementation

**Impact Assessment**:
- **Requirements Impact**: No new requirements - documentation created organically during Milestones 1-2
- **Scope Impact**: Milestone 6 marked as deferred, reducing active milestone count
- **Timeline Impact**: Eliminates redundant milestone, accelerates path to CI/CD
- **Sequencing Impact**: Updated path: Milestone 1 ✅ → 2 ✅ → 5 (Unit Test Elimination) → 3 (CI/CD)
- **Documentation Impact**: Updated milestone status and sequencing in PRD

**Milestone 6 Status**: ⬜ **DEFERRED (effectively complete)**
- Test maintenance documentation: ✅ Exists in tests/integration/CLAUDE.md
- Test adding guidelines: ✅ Exists in docs/integration-testing-guide.md
- Performance optimization: → Deferred to Milestone 3 (CI/CD)
- Monitoring/alerting: → Deferred to Milestone 3 (CI/CD)
- Release process integration: → Deferred to Milestone 3 (CI/CD)

**Next Session Priorities**:
- **Milestone 5**: Unit Test Elimination (Phase 1 - delete tool unit tests for 6 validated tools)
- **Final**: Milestone 3: CI/CD Integration with performance optimization and monitoring

---

### 2025-09-30: Milestone 5 Complete - Unit Test Elimination
**Duration**: ~1.5 hours
**Primary Focus**: Complete removal of all unit tests and test infrastructure

**Completed Work**:
- **Deleted 40 unit test files**:
  - 9 tool unit test files (tests/tools/*.test.ts)
  - 22 core unit test files (tests/core/*.test.ts)
  - 2 interface unit test files (tests/interfaces/*.test.ts)
  - 1 MCP test file (tests/mcp/server.test.ts)
  - 6 root-level test files (tests/*.test.ts)
- **Deleted test infrastructure**:
  - tests/setup.ts (unit test setup file)
  - tests/__mocks__/ directory with Kubernetes client mocks
  - tests/fixtures/ directory with 8 YAML fixture files
  - Empty test directories (tests/tools, tests/core, tests/interfaces, tests/mcp, tests/integration/scenarios, tests/integration/journeys)
- **Removed Jest configuration**:
  - Removed jest, @types/jest, ts-jest from devDependencies in package.json
  - Removed entire jest configuration block from package.json
  - Removed unit test npm scripts (pretest, test, test:verbose, test:watch, test:coverage)
  - Removed ci, ci:test, ci:build npm scripts (CI/CD to be implemented in Milestone 3)
  - Updated main test script to point to integration tests: `"test": "npm run test:integration"`
- **Updated documentation**:
  - README.md: Changed contributing section to reference integration testing guide
  - CLAUDE.md: Updated test directory comment to reflect integration-only testing
  - tests/integration/CLAUDE.md: Added section on running integration tests in Claude Code with timeout guidance

**Validation**:
- All 38 integration tests pass successfully (6 test files)
- Test suite duration: 373.80s (~6.2 minutes)
- Zero unit tests remaining in codebase
- Integration tests provide complete coverage of critical functionality

**Achievement**: Project now follows "zero unit tests" philosophy - all tests validate real system behavior with actual Kubernetes clusters, AI services, and databases. No mocks to maintain, no mock drift issues.

**Milestone 5 Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
- All phases completed in single session
- Seamless transition from unit+integration tests to integration-only testing
- All integration tests passing with no regressions

**Next Session Priorities**:
- ✅ **Milestone 3 COMPLETE** - All milestones now complete
- Monitor first PR workflow run for any issues
- Address any CI/CD issues that emerge during actual PR testing

---

### 2025-09-30: Milestone 3 Complete - CI/CD Pipeline Integration
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Primary Focus**: GitHub Actions integration for automated integration testing on PRs

**Completed PRD Items**:
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow for integration tests - Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with complete integration test job
- [x] Test Kubernetes cluster provisioning - Workflow installs Kind/kubectl/Helm directly (no Devbox), runs setup script
- [x] Test result reporting and PR status integration - Automatic via GitHub Actions PR status checks
- [x] Failure notification and debugging support - Built-in GitHub Actions logging and notifications

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Cost optimization**: Tests run only on PRs (not on merge to main) to save API costs
- **No cleanup needed**: GitHub Actions VMs are destroyed after workflow, no manual teardown required
- **No artifact upload**: VM cleanup handles everything, no need to persist test results
- **Direct tool installation**: Kind, kubectl, Helm installed via curl (faster than Devbox)
- **Simple workflow**: 8-minute cluster setup, 15-minute test execution, 30-minute total timeout

**Design Decisions**:
- **PR-only execution**: `if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'` - Runs on PR create/update, skips main merge
- **Minimal dependencies**: Only install what's needed (Kind, kubectl, Helm), skip Devbox overhead
- **Lean workflow**: No test artifacts, no cleanup step - rely on VM destruction
