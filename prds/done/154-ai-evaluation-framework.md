## Standard Framework Analysis

### OpenAI Evals Standard
**Core Components:**
```jsonl
// Standard dataset format (samples.jsonl)
{"input": "Deploy PostgreSQL database", "ideal": "Use StatefulSet with persistent storage", "metadata": {"category": "database", "complexity": "medium"}}

// Standard evaluation config
{
  "eval_name": "dot-ai-kubernetes-deployment",
  "eval_spec": {
    "cls": "evals.elsuite.basic.match:Match", 
    "args": {"samples_jsonl": "k8s-deployment.jsonl"}
  },
  "completion_fns": ["anthropic/claude-sonnet", "openai/gpt-4"]
}
```

### LangSmith Standard
**Evaluation Structure:**
```typescript
interface LangSmithEval {
  dataset_name: string;
  evaluators: Evaluator[];
  experiment_prefix: string;
  metadata: {
    version: string;
    description: string;
    tags: string[];
  };
}
```

### Industry Best Practices
1. **Standardized Datasets**: JSONL format with input/ideal/metadata structure
2. **Evaluation Metrics**: Named evaluators (correctness, relevance, safety, etc.)
3. **Reproducible Results**: Deterministic scoring with confidence intervals
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Multi-model evaluation with statistical significance
5. **Versioned Experiments**: Track evaluation changes over time

## Technical Architecture (Standards-Compliant)

### 1. Standard Dataset Format
```typescript
// Replace current ad-hoc test cases with standard format
interface StandardEvalSample {
  input: {
    prompt: string;
    context?: Record<string, any>;
  };
  ideal: string | string[];                    // Expected output(s)
  metadata: {
    category: string;                          // "deployment" | "remediation" | "testing"
    complexity: "low" | "medium" | "high";
    tags: string[];
    source: string;                            // Where this sample came from
  };
}

// Example datasets:
// eval-datasets/kubernetes-deployment.jsonl
// eval-datasets/troubleshooting-remediation.jsonl  
// eval-datasets/documentation-testing.jsonl
```

### 2. Standard Evaluators
```typescript
// Follow LangSmith evaluator pattern
interface StandardEvaluator {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  evaluate(input: any, output: string, ideal?: string): Promise<EvaluationScore>;
}

class CorrectnessEvaluator implements StandardEvaluator {
  name = "correctness";
  description = "Measures factual accuracy of AI output";
  
  async evaluate(input: any, output: string, ideal: string): Promise<EvaluationScore> {
    // Use model-graded evaluation following OpenAI pattern
    const score = await this.aiProvider.evaluate({
      criteria: "factual accuracy",
      input, output, ideal
    });
    
    return {
      key: "correctness",
      score: score,
      comment: "Evaluation reasoning...",
      confidence: 0.9
    };
  }
}
```

### 3. Standard Experiment Tracking
```typescript
// Follow MLflow/LangSmith experiment structure
interface EvaluationExperiment {
  experiment_id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  dataset_name: string;
  model: string;
  evaluators: string[];
  results: {
    summary: {
      total_samples: number;
      avg_score: number;
      scores_by_evaluator: Record<string, number>;
      cost_usd: number;
      duration_seconds: number;
    };
    samples: Array<{
      sample_id: string;
      input: any;
      output: string;
      ideal?: string;
      scores: Record<string, EvaluationScore>;
      metadata: Record<string, any>;
    }>;
  };
  created_at: string;
  tags: string[];
}
```

## Standard Evaluator Implementation

### Following OpenAI Evals Pattern
```typescript
// Standard evaluator base class
abstract class StandardEvaluator {
  abstract name: string;
  abstract description: string;
  
  abstract async evaluate(
    input: any,
    output: string,
    ideal?: string
  ): Promise<EvaluationScore>;
  
  // Standard confidence calculation
  calculateConfidence(scores: number[]): number {
    // Standard deviation based confidence
    const mean = scores.reduce((a, b) => a + b) / scores.length;
    const std = Math.sqrt(scores.reduce((sq, n) => sq + (n - mean) ** 2) / scores.length);
    return Math.max(0, Math.min(1, 1 - (std / mean)));
  }
}

// Kubernetes-specific evaluators following standard pattern
class KubernetesCorrectnessEvaluator extends StandardEvaluator {
  name = "k8s_correctness";
  description = "Evaluates correctness of Kubernetes recommendations";
  
  async evaluate(input: any, output: string, ideal: string): Promise<EvaluationScore> {
    // Use model-graded evaluation with K8s expertise
    const gradingPrompt = `
    You are evaluating a Kubernetes recommendation for correctness.
    
    Input: ${JSON.stringify(input)}
    AI Output: ${output}
    Expected: ${ideal}
    
    Rate 0-1 how correct the AI output is compared to the expected answer.
    Consider: resource types, configuration accuracy, best practices.
    
    Return only a number between 0 and 1.
    `;
    
    const response = await this.aiProvider.sendMessage(gradingPrompt);
    const score = parseFloat(response.content) || 0;
    
    return {
      key: this.name,
      score: score,
      comment: `Kubernetes correctness evaluation`,
      confidence: 0.9
    };
  }
}

## Work Log

### 2025-10-08: Tactical Evaluation System Improvements
**Duration**: ~4 hours (estimated from conversation flow)
**Focus**: Foundational improvements to existing evaluation infrastructure

**Additional Work Done (Outside PRD Scope)**:
- **Unified Metrics System**: Consolidated `logMetrics` and `EvaluationContext` into single `EvaluationMetrics` interface in `src/core/providers/provider-debug-utils.ts`
- **Token Count Accuracy**: Fixed Vercel AI SDK token reporting (~70% discrepancy resolved using `result.totalUsage` instead of `result.usage`)
- **Debug File Coordination**: Improved debug file naming, content extraction, and metrics references between providers
- **Evaluation Noise Reduction**: Removed intermediate iteration logging for cleaner metrics (reduced from 26+ entries to expected 4 per test run)
- **Context Completeness**: Added missing user intent and system prompts to Vercel provider debug files

**Technical Discoveries**:
- Vercel AI SDK `result.usage` only reports final step tokens; `result.totalUsage` required for multi-step token accuracy
- Token count discrepancy between Anthropic native SDK and Vercel AI SDK resolved (now matching: 10K-32K tokens vs previous 2K-9K)
- Current custom evaluation system provides solid foundation for future standards compliance
- Debug file coordination between providers requires careful operation name management

**Evidence of Completion**:
- Integration tests passing with accurate token counts
- Debug files contain complete prompts with real content instead of `[content]` placeholders
- Metrics show clean high-level MCP tool calls without iteration noise
- User intent properly included in Vercel provider debug prompts

**Strategic Value**:
These tactical improvements strengthen the existing evaluation infrastructure and provide a solid foundation for future migration to industry-standard frameworks. The enhanced metrics accuracy, debug coordination, and unified interface reduce technical debt while maintaining evaluation capabilities.

**Next Session Priorities** (if continuing tactical approach):
- Address debug file naming differentiation between investigation/validation phases
- Consider provider performance comparison using improved token accuracy
- Evaluate prompt optimization opportunities with better debug context

**Next Session Priorities** (updated based on design decisions):
- Run integration tests with multiple providers (Claude, GPT-5, Gemini) to generate evaluation data
- Build metrics extraction pipeline from `metrics.jsonl` files to standard JSONL datasets  
- Implement multi-dimensional evaluator framework for correctness and efficiency analysis

### 2025-10-08: Strategic Design Decisions
**Duration**: ~2 hours (design discussion)
**Focus**: Evaluation approach strategy and multi-dimensional assessment framework

**Key Design Decisions**:

1. **Multi-Provider Integration Test Approach**
   - **Decision**: Use existing multi-provider integration test capability instead of manual scenario extraction
   - **Rationale**: More cost-effective (3N vs 4N AI calls), captures real system behavior, leverages existing infrastructure
   - **Impact**: Changes Milestone 1 approach from manual conversion to automated result extraction
   - **Implementation**: Run tests with multiple providers, extract from generated `metrics.jsonl` files

2. **Comprehensive Multi-Dimensional Evaluation**
   - **Decision**: Evaluate both output correctness AND process efficiency (tokens, steps, reasoning quality)
   - **Rationale**: Provides richer insights than correctness alone, existing debug infrastructure already captures efficiency data
   - **Impact**: Expands evaluation criteria beyond simple correctness scoring to include cost-effectiveness and reasoning quality
   - **Implementation**: Add efficiency evaluators alongside correctness evaluators in Milestone 2

3. **Integration Test Result Mining**
   - **Decision**: Extract evaluation data from actual integration test execution rather than synthetic scenarios
   - **Rationale**: Provides authentic real-world performance data within actual system context
   - **Impact**: Ensures evaluation datasets reflect actual usage patterns and system constraints
   - **Implementation**: Build pipeline to convert integration test metrics to standard evaluation datasets

**Technical Architecture Updates**:
- Enhanced `provider-debug-utils.ts` role: Now supports multi-provider evaluation data extraction
- New evaluation dimensions: correctness, efficiency, cost-effectiveness, reasoning quality
- Integration test pipeline integration: Systematic evaluation dataset generation from real test runs

**Strategic Value**:
These decisions optimize for cost-effectiveness while providing comprehensive evaluation coverage. The multi-provider integration test approach leverages existing infrastructure investments while generating authentic performance data. Multi-dimensional evaluation enables optimization across correctness, efficiency, and cost - critical for production AI system optimization.

4. **Reference-Free Evaluation Methodology**
   - **Decision**: Use AI-as-judge comparative evaluation without predetermined "ideal" answers
   - **Rationale**: Kubernetes problems often have multiple valid solutions; reference-free evaluation is industry standard for complex domains
   - **Impact**: Eliminates manual answer curation burden, enables evaluation of nuanced problem-solving approaches
   - **Implementation**: AI evaluator compares providers against each other rather than gold standard answers

5. **Weighted Multi-Criteria Evaluation Framework**
   - **Decision**: Group metrics into weighted categories (Quality 40%, Efficiency 30%, Performance 20%, Communication 10%)
   - **Rationale**: Prevents cognitive overload for evaluator AI, allows customization for different use cases, provides interpretable results
   - **Impact**: Defines clear evaluation structure enabling systematic comparison and optimization
   - **Implementation**: Configurable evaluation profiles for different scenarios (production-critical, cost-optimization, real-time)

6. **JSON Output with JSONL Storage**
   - **Decision**: Instruct AI evaluator to output structured JSON, then append to JSONL files for batch analysis
   - **Rationale**: Enables systematic analysis while maintaining compatibility with industry evaluation tools
   - **Impact**: Defines evaluation result storage pipeline and enables time-series performance analysis
   - **Implementation**: JSON schema validation with JSONL batch processing for aggregated insights

7. **Minimal Data Enhancement Strategy**
   - **Decision**: Add only `user_intent` field and empty `failure_analysis` placeholder to current metrics.jsonl
   - **Rationale**: Test success implies solution success; manual analysis only when tests fail; minimal implementation overhead
   - **Impact**: Makes current metrics evaluation-ready with minimal changes to existing infrastructure
   - **Implementation**: Enhance metrics collection with user intent, assume test success = solution success

8. **Test Setup Context for Evaluation Completeness**
   - **Decision**: Add `setup_context` field capturing test scenario setup (broken deployments, resource limits, etc.)
   - **Rationale**: AI evaluator needs to understand what was actually broken to assess solution quality properly
   - **Impact**: Enables meaningful evaluation of diagnosis accuracy - evaluator can validate if root cause identification matches actual setup
   - **Implementation**: Extract setup instructions from integration test code and include in metrics collection
