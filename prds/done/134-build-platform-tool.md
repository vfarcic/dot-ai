# PRD 134: Build Platform MCP Tool

**Status**: Draft
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**GitHub Issue**: [#134](https://github.com/vfarcic/dot-ai/issues/134)
**Priority**: High
**Target Release**: TBD

---

## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
Users building Kubernetes platforms must manually discover, learn, and execute infrastructure scripts with correct arguments. This requires deep knowledge of available tools, script locations, command syntax, and configuration options - creating a steep learning curve and error-prone manual processes.

### Solution Overview
An AI-powered MCP tool (`buildPlatform`) that dynamically discovers available platform operations from Nu shell scripts, interprets natural language user intent, guides users through conversational workflows to collect necessary parameters, and executes infrastructure scripts automatically.

### Success Metrics
- Users can install platform tools without knowing script names or locations
- Zero-knowledge onboarding: new users successfully build platforms through conversation
- Reduced time to platform setup (measure: time from intent to successful execution)
- Reduced configuration errors (measure: script execution success rate)

User sees: "What hostname should I use?" → Execution result
```

**Design Philosophy**: Users never see or interact with script operations directly. The tool presents as a conversational platform management assistant, not a script executor.

### Key Components

**Component 1: Nushell Runtime Checker**
- File: `src/core/nushell-runtime.ts`
- Responsibility: Detect Nushell installation, provide setup instructions
- Key Methods: `checkNushellInstalled()`, `getInstallInstructions()`

**Component 2: Script Discovery Engine** (Internal)
- File: `src/core/platform-operations.ts`
- Responsibility: Parse dot.nu help output, extract available operations (hidden from users)
- Key Methods: `discoverOperations()`, `categorizeOperations()`
- Usage: Internal only - used for intent mapping, never exposed to users

**Component 3: Script Argument Parser** (Internal)
- File: `src/core/script-parser.ts`
- Responsibility: Parse operation --help output, extract argument metadata (hidden from users)
- Key Methods: `parseHelp()`, `extractArguments()`, `detectArgumentType()`
- Usage: Internal only - converts script help into conversational questions

**Component 4: Session Manager**
- File: `src/core/platform-session.ts`
- Responsibility: Manage workflow state, persist sessions, track progress
- Key Methods: `createSession()`, `updateSession()`, `getNextQuestion()`
- Storage: `./tmp/sessions/platform/{sessionId}.json`

**Component 5: Intent Mapper** (Critical User-Facing)
- File: `src/core/platform-operations.ts`
- Responsibility: Map natural language intent to script commands (transparent to user)
- Strategy: Keyword matching + context analysis
- Examples: "Install Argo CD" → `apply argocd`, "Create AWS cluster" → `create kubernetes`
- User Experience: User never sees or knows about script commands

**Component 6: Script Executor**
- File: `src/core/platform-operations.ts`
- Responsibility: Execute Nu shell scripts, capture output, handle errors
- Key Methods: `executeScript()`, `buildCommand()`, `captureOutput()`

**Component 7: MCP Tool Handler**
- File: `src/tools/build-platform.ts`
- Responsibility: MCP interface with stage-based workflow control
- Schema:
  - `stage` (optional): Workflow stage - `'list'` to discover all operations
  - `intent` (optional): Natural language intent for operation mapping
  - `sessionId` (optional): For workflow continuation
  - `response` (optional): For parameter collection in multi-step workflows
- Design: Stage-based control allows explicit operation discovery (`stage: 'list'`) or direct intent mapping (`intent: 'Install Argo CD'`)

### Data Models

**Session State:**
```typescript
interface PlatformSession {
  sessionId: string;
  command: string[];  // e.g., ["apply", "argocd"]
  arguments: ArgumentMetadata[];
  answers: Record<string, any>;
  currentStep: 'intent' | 'args' | 'confirm' | 'execute' | 'complete';
  currentArgIndex: number;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

**Argument Metadata:**
```typescript
interface ArgumentMetadata {
  name: string;
  type: 'string' | 'number' | 'boolean' | 'choice';
  required: boolean;
  description: string;
  default?: any;
  choices?: string[];  // For choice type
}
```

### Integration Points

- **MCP Server**: Register tool in `src/interfaces/mcp.ts`
- **REST API**: Expose via REST registry for HTTP clients
- **File System**: Read scripts from `./scripts/` directory
- **Process Execution**: Spawn Nu shell processes
- **Session Storage**: Write to `./tmp/sessions/platform/`

  - Version: >= 0.95.0 recommended
  - Installation varies by platform (brew, cargo, winget)
  - Must be in PATH or Docker image

### Internal Prerequisites
1. **Script Modifications**: All scripts must be updated to accept arguments instead of interactive prompts
2. **Packaging**: Scripts directory must be included in npm package and Docker image
3. **Docker Image**: Nushell must be installed in Dockerfile

### System Requirements
- **Local Development**: Nushell installed on developer machine
- **Docker**: Nushell binary in container image

- Client agent guidance: Tool provides data + presentation instructions, client handles UX

**Next Session Priorities**:
- Phase 3: Implement intent mapping to operations
- Handle ambiguous intents (multiple matches)
- Begin parameter collection workflow for selected operations

### 2025-10-03: Milestone 1 Complete - Script Conversion to Argument-Based
**Duration**: ~4 hours
**Approach**: Systematic conversion of all interactive credential prompts

**Completed Work**:
- [x] Converted all credential prompts to parameter-based with env var fallback
- [x] Updated 11 major scripts: crossplane.nu, kubernetes.nu, ack.nu, aso.nu, github.nu, anthropic.nu, image.nu, registry.nu, port.nu, common.nu, argocd.nu (already done)
- [x] Implemented consistent error handling pattern across all scripts
- [x] Preserved environment variable fallback behavior

**Scripts Modified**:
- **crossplane.nu**: Added --aws-access-key-id, --aws-secret-access-key, --azure-tenant, --upcloud-username, --upcloud-password to main function and setup helper functions
- **kubernetes.nu**: Added credentials parameters to main function and helper functions (create eks, create aks, create upcloud)
- **ack.nu**: Added --aws-access-key-id, --aws-secret-access-key
- **aso.nu**: Added --azure-tenant
- **common.nu**: Added --aws-access-key-id, --aws-secret-access-key, --aws-account-id, --azure-tenant
- **github.nu**: Added --github-token, --github-org
- **anthropic.nu**: Added --anthropic-api-key
- **image.nu**: Added --container-registry
- **registry.nu**: Added --registry-server, --registry-user, --registry-email, --registry-password
- **port.nu**: Added --port-client-id, --port-client-secret

**Conversion Pattern Implemented**:
```nushell
mut value = $parameter
if ($value | is-empty) and (ENV_VAR in $env) {
    $value = $env.ENV_VAR
} else if ($value | is-empty) {
    error make { msg: "Value required via --parameter or ENV_VAR environment variable" }
}
```

**Design Decision**:
- **Manual confirmation prompts**: Explicitly decided to keep (not blocking for MCP automation - tools can handle async workflows for browser-based manual steps)
- **Provider selection menu**: Deferred (low priority, workaround available via direct provider specification)

**Next Session Priorities**:
- Milestone 6: Package scripts in npm distribution, add Nushell to Docker
- Milestone 7: Write user documentation
- End-to-end validation testing via MCP client

### 2025-10-03: Milestone 6 Progress - Scripts Packaged in npm
**Duration**: ~1 hour
**Approach**: Configure npm packaging and fix path resolution

**Completed Work**:
- [x] Added `scripts` directory to package.json `files` array
- [x] Fixed script path resolution to work in installed packages (changed from `process.cwd()` to `__dirname`)
- [x] Verified all 29 .nu scripts included in npm pack output
- [x] Created `getScriptsDir()` helper function for reliable path resolution

**Technical Changes**:
- **package.json**: Added `"scripts"` to files array (line 68)
- **platform-operations.ts**:
  - Added `getScriptsDir()` function using `__dirname` for package-relative paths
  - Updated 3 functions to use `getScriptsDir()`: `discoverOperations()`, `getOperationParameters()`, `executeOperation()`
  - Path resolution: `dist/core/ -> ../../scripts/` works in both dev and installed package

**Path Resolution Logic**:
- Development: `dist/core/__dirname -> ../../scripts` = project root scripts
- Installed: `node_modules/@vfarcic/dot-ai/dist/core/__dirname -> ../../scripts` = package scripts directory
- All 29 scripts discoverable and executable in both scenarios

**Next Session Priorities**:
- Add Nushell to Docker image
- Test packaged version end-to-end
- Write installation instructions

### 2025-10-03: Phase 3 - Intent Mapping & Execution Complete
**Duration**: ~4 hours (analysis + implementation)
**Status**: Milestones 2, 3, 4 complete - Core functionality working end-to-end

**Discovered**: Phase 3 was already fully implemented! Code review revealed:
- Intent mapping with AI-powered matching (`mapIntentToOperation`)
- Parameter extraction via Nushell introspection (`getOperationParameters`)
- Session management with persistence (create/load/save)
- Full workflow: intent → parameters → execution
- Comprehensive error handling (unmatched intents, missing params, validation)
- 5 integration tests all passing (300s timeout tests)

**Completed PRD Items**:
- [x] Intent mapping handles common use cases - Tested with Argo CD, cert-manager
- [x] Multi-step workflow with session persistence - Session creation/loading working

- [x] Milestone 2 complete - Parameter extraction via Nushell scope commands
- [x] Milestone 3 complete - All workflow and session management items
- [x] Milestone 4 complete - All script execution and error handling items

**Implementation Highlights**:
- AI-powered intent matching uses Claude to map natural language to operations
- Nushell introspection (`scope commands | where name == "X" | to json`) extracts structured parameter metadata
- Zero-parameter operations execute immediately (no unnecessary parameter collection)
- Session persistence enables resumable workflows across multiple tool calls
- Comprehensive test coverage validates real Kubernetes deployments (Argo CD, cert-manager)

**Key Files Modified**:
- `src/tools/build-platform.ts` - Intent mapping workflow and submitAnswers stage

```

**Validation Results**:
- AMD64 build: ✅ Successfully built, Nushell v0.107.0 installed at `/usr/local/bin/nu`
- ARM64 build: ✅ Successfully built, Nushell v0.107.0 installed at `/usr/local/bin/nu`
- Execution test: ✅ `nu -c "print 'Nushell is working!'"` works in both architectures

**Next Session Priorities**:
- Milestone 7: Write user documentation with usage examples
- End-to-end validation via MCP client (Claude Code)
- Prepare feature announcement

### 2025-10-03: PRD 134 Complete - Feature Launch
**Status**: ✅ All milestones complete, feature validated and launched

**Final Validation**:
- [x] End-to-end validation completed manually via MCP client
- [x] Validation testing performed on all acceptance criteria
- [x] Feature confirmed working in production environment

**Definition of Done**: 10/10 items complete (100%)
- All implementation milestones achieved
- All packaging and distribution complete
- User documentation comprehensive and tested
- Feature launched and available in MCP

**Next Steps**: None - PRD complete and ready for closure

### 2025-10-03: Milestone 7 Complete - User Documentation
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Approach**: Incremental documentation with real MCP tool testing

**Completed Work**:
- [x] Created comprehensive user guide (`docs/mcp-build-platform-guide.md`)
  - Prerequisites section with clear local vs Docker dependency requirements
  - Overview and key features explanation
  - Optional operation discovery workflow (tested with `stage: 'list'`)
  - Complete Argo CD installation example (tested full workflow: intent → parameters → execution)
  - Used actual MCP tool outputs in examples (not placeholder text)
- [x] Updated tools overview (`docs/mcp-tools-overview.md`)
  - Added Platform Building tool entry with 🏗️ emoji icon
  - Updated Tool Dependencies section to include buildPlatform
- [x] Updated README.md
  - Added Platform Building to "Who is this for?" section (Platform Engineers, New Team Members, DevOps Teams)
  - Added Platform Building to Key Features section with feature bullets

**Documentation Approach**:
- Followed existing documentation format (similar to mcp-remediate-guide.md, mcp-recommendation-guide.md)
- Tested each feature before documenting (discovery and installation workflows)
- Used real MCP tool outputs in all examples
- Kept examples concise (truncated tool list to representative sample, single comprehensive workflow example)
- Cross-referenced with other documentation

**Next Session Priorities**:
- End-to-end validation via MCP client (Claude Code or similar)
- Formal validation testing of the 5 validation criteria
- Feature launch announcement (deferred until after validation)

### 2025-10-02: Initial PRD Creation
- PRD created (issue #134)
- Initial scope and requirements defined
- Technical approach validated through planning discussion

## Open Questions & Decisions

### Questions to Resolve
1. **Script modification ownership**: Who reviews/approves script changes?
2. **Version compatibility**: What minimum Nushell version should we support?
3. **Timeout values**: What are reasonable timeouts for different operation types?
4. **Session expiry**: How long should sessions persist before cleanup?

### Decisions Made
- ✅ Tool name: `buildPlatform`
- ✅ Priority: High
- ✅ Approach: Dynamic discovery (not hardcoded operations)
- ✅ Script modification strategy: Convert all to argument-based
- ✅ Nushell requirement: Mandatory, with clear installation instructions
- ✅ **User Interface Philosophy** (2025-10-02): Nushell scripts are implementation details that should be completely hidden from users. Users express intent ("Install Argo CD"), system handles script discovery, mapping, and execution transparently. Tool should feel like `recommend` or `remediate` - intent-driven, not operation-driven.
- ✅ **Development Methodology** (2025-10-02): TDD approach with integration tests first. For each workflow phase: (1) Write integration test, (2) See it fail (red), (3) Implement minimal code to pass (green), (4) Refactor if needed, (5) Move to next phase. Integration tests drive API design and validate tool interface early.
- ✅ **Workflow Control Pattern** (2025-10-02): Stage-based workflow control following project patterns (`recommend` uses `stage`, `manageOrgData` uses `sessionId` + `step`). Tool supports: (1) `stage: 'list'` without intent to discover all available operations, (2) `intent: 'Install Argo CD'` for direct natural language mapping to operations, (3) Ambiguous intents return multiple matching operations for user clarification. Intent and stage parameters are both optional but at least one should be provided.

## Future Enhancements

### Post-V1 Considerations
- **Parallel execution**: Install multiple tools simultaneously
- **Rollback capability**: Undo operations if something fails
- **Operation history**: Track what's been installed/configured
- **Dependency detection**: Warn if prerequisites missing
- **Cost estimation**: Estimate cloud costs before cluster creation
- **Template support**: Save common configurations as reusable templates
- **Dry-run mode**: Show what would be executed without running it
- **Progress streaming**: Real-time progress for long operations
