# PRD: Comprehensive Documentation Testing Mechanism

**Created**: 2025-07-19
**Status**: Complete
**Owner**: Viktor Farcic
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-22

## Executive Summary
AI-powered documentation validation system that automatically executes commands, tests examples, and validates claims in documentation files to ensure accuracy and prevent documentation drift.

## Problem Statement
Documentation frequently becomes outdated and unreliable due to:
- Commands that no longer work as described
- Code examples that fail when users try them
- Instructions that skip crucial setup steps
- Claims about software behavior that become inaccurate over time
- Manual testing processes that are time-consuming and error-prone

This leads to user frustration, reduced adoption, and loss of credibility for documentation.

## Interface Requirements

This system provides MCP interface for AI agent integration:
- **MCP Interface**: Model Context Protocol server for AI agent integration via tools like Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code

All functionality, workflows, and capabilities are accessible through the MCP interface.

## Proposed Solution
Comprehensive AI-driven testing system that:
- Automatically discovers and categorizes testable content in documentation
- Executes commands and examples in safe, isolated environments
- Validates both functional accuracy (does it work?) and semantic accuracy (are the descriptions truthful?)
- Provides structured feedback with actionable improvement recommendations
- Supports resumable, session-based workflows for large documentation sets
- Maintains detailed audit trails of testing results and changes

## User Stories & Use Cases
- As a **documentation maintainer**, I want automated validation of all examples so that I can catch outdated content before users encounter it
- As a **development team member**, I want documentation testing integrated into CI/CD so that code changes don't break documented examples
- As a **technical writer**, I want to understand which sections need updates so that I can prioritize my work effectively
- As a **open source maintainer**, I want confidence that my README and docs work for new contributors so that onboarding is smooth
- As a **product manager**, I want metrics on documentation quality so that I can track improvements over time

## Technical Implementation Checklist

### Architecture & Design âœ… **COMPLETED**
- [x] TypeScript implementation with comprehensive type safety
- [x] Session-based state management using JSON persistence
- [x] Shared validation engine accessible via MCP interface
- [x] Comprehensive error handling and graceful failure modes
- [x] File-based prompt system following CLAUDE.md patterns
- [x] **Trackable item data structure** - Issues and recommendations as objects with id/text/status/explanation
- [x] **Fix phase workflow design** - Client-agent driven fix selection and application with status tracking

### Data Structure Design ðŸ”„ **UPDATED** (2025-07-20)

**Enhanced SectionTestResult Interface**:
```typescript
interface FixableItem {
  id: number;                    // Sequential ID across all sections (1,2,3,4...)
  text: string;                  // Issue or recommendation description  
  status: 'pending' | 'fixed' | 'deferred' | 'failed';
  explanation?: string;          // Context for non-pending status
}

interface SectionTestResult {
  whatWasDone: string;
  issues: FixableItem[];         // Trackable issues instead of string[]
  recommendations: FixableItem[]; // Trackable recommendations instead of string[]
}
```

**Fix Phase Workflow**:
1. **Present numbered list** of all pending items to client agent
2. **User selects fixes** by number (1,3,5 or "all" or "none") 
3. **Client agent applies fixes** (doc edits, code changes, external actions)
4. **Client reports status** for each selected item (fixed/deferred/failed)
5. **System updates tracking** and presents remaining items
6. **Loop continues** until user selects "none" or no items remain

**Status Definitions**:
- **pending**: Not yet addressed
- **fixed**: Completed (any type of resolution)
- **deferred**: Handled via external action (GitHub issue, backlog) - removed from future sessions
- **failed**: Attempted but couldn't complete - remains available for retry

### Development Tasks âœ… **COMPLETED**
- [x] Core validation workflow implementation
- [x] Section discovery and management

- [ ] **Risk**: AI analysis quality could vary significantly | **Mitigation**: Develop validation metrics and feedback loops | **Owner**: Product Team

### Mitigation Actions
- [x] Implement comprehensive error handling throughout workflow
- [x] Create robust session state management with recovery capabilities
- [ ] Develop performance monitoring and optimization strategies
- [ ] Establish quality metrics for AI analysis effectiveness

## Decision Log

### Open Questions
- [ ] **Fix Application Scope**: Should fix application be automatic, user-guided, or user-selected? | **Target**: Phase 4 kickoff
- [ ] **CI/CD Integration Approach**: What's the best way to integrate with existing development workflows? | **Target**: Phase 4 planning

### Resolved Decisions
- [x] **Two-Phase Validation Approach** - **Decided**: 2025-07-19 **Rationale**: Functional testing alone missed semantic accuracy issues; combined approach provides comprehensive validation
- [x] **JSON Result Format** - **Decided**: 2025-07-19 **Rationale**: Structured data enables better analysis and processing in later phases compared to free-form text
- [x] **Automatic Workflow Progression** - **Decided**: 2025-07-19 **Rationale**: Manual CLI calls between sections created friction; automatic progression improves user experience
- [x] **File-based Prompt System** - **Decided**: 2025-07-18 **Rationale**: Separates AI instructions from code, enables easier prompt iteration and collaboration
- [x] **Simplified 4-Phase Workflow** - **Decided**: 2025-07-19 **Rationale**: SCAN â†’ TEST â†’ ANALYZE â†’ FIX approach with document-level coherence analysis and user-driven fix selection is simpler and more practical than complex coordination systems
- [x] **Eliminate Document Coherence Analysis** - **Decided**: 2025-07-20 **Rationale**: Analysis of existing TEST phase revealed comprehensive functional and semantic validation already occurring (difficulty claims, automation claims, user experience validation, etc.), making additional document-level analysis redundant
- [x] **Focus on Fix Application Only** - **Decided**: 2025-07-20 **Rationale**: TEST phase provides comprehensive issue identification and recommendations; users need way to select and apply fixes rather than additional analysis
- [x] **Remove Workflow Selection** - **Decided**: 2025-07-20 **Rationale**: Simplified approach - users run documentation testing and get fix recommendations, no need for mode selection complexity
- [x] **Trackable Item Data Structure** - **Decided**: 2025-07-20 **Rationale**: Convert issues and recommendations from string arrays to objects with id, text, status, and explanation fields for comprehensive fix tracking
- [x] **Four-Status Fix Tracking** - **Decided**: 2025-07-20 **Rationale**: Use pending/fixed/deferred/failed status system where deferred items (handled via GitHub issues, backlog, etc.) are considered resolved and removed from future sessions
- [x] **Client-Agent Fix Application** - **Decided**: 2025-07-20 **Rationale**: Client agent and user determine how to handle each recommendation (doc edit, code fix, external issue), system provides tracking and numbered list interface
- [x] **Simple Sequential Fix IDs** - **Decided**: 2025-07-20 **Rationale**: Use simple numbering (1,2,3,4) rather than section-based IDs (2.1, 4.3) for easier user selection and reduced cognitive load
- [x] **Move Phase 5 to Separate PRD** - **Decided**: 2025-07-22 **Rationale**: Recursive documentation testing represents substantial core functionality deserving dedicated PRD for proper tracking and planning, allowing PRD 12 to achieve completion
- [x] **PRD 12 Scope Completion** - **Decided**: 2025-07-22 **Rationale**: With Phase 5 moved to separate PRD and build errors resolved, all single-document testing functionality is complete and functional
