# PRD: Kubernetes Remediation Tool

**Issue**: #97  
**Created**: 2025-01-10  
**Status**: Complete  
**Completed**: 2025-01-20  
**Priority**: High  
**Owner**: TBD  

## Executive Summary

Add a new MCP tool called `remediate` that receives Kubernetes issues and events, analyzes them using AI, and provides remediation recommendations or executes fixes. This tool will be callable from multiple sources including Kubernetes controllers, human agents via Claude Code, and CI/CD pipelines.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
- Kubernetes operational issues require manual intervention, increasing MTTR
- No standardized approach to common cluster problems
- Knowledge of fixes is distributed across team members
- Repetitive issues consume significant operational time
- Lack of automated response to predictable failures

### User Impact
- **DevOps Teams**: Spend excessive time on repetitive incident response
- **On-call Engineers**: Face alert fatigue from issues that could be auto-remediated
- **Platform Teams**: Struggle to maintain consistent remediation practices across clusters

## Success Criteria

- Reduce MTTR for common Kubernetes issues by 50%
- Successfully auto-remediate 80% of targeted event types
- Provide actionable recommendations for 95% of analyzed issues
- Support both automated and manual approval workflows
- Zero false-positive remediations that cause service degradation

## Scope

### In Scope
- New MCP tool (`remediate`) for issue analysis and remediation
- AI-powered analysis using existing Claude integration
- Cluster capability discovery and operator-aware remediation
- Support for multiple trigger sources (controller, human, API)
- Manual and automatic remediation modes
- Structured remediation reporting and audit trails

### Out of Scope
- Kubernetes controller implementation (separate project - future PRD)
- Notification systems and delivery mechanisms (controller/caller responsibility)
- Multi-cluster orchestration (future enhancement)
- Custom resource definitions (controller project)
- Event watching and filtering (controller responsibility)
- Business context and persona-specific configuration (controller responsibility)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Issue Analysis**
   - Accept structured issue descriptions with context
   - Analyze logs, metrics, and related events
   - Identify root causes using AI

2. **Remediation Generation**
   - Generate specific remediation steps
   - Provide risk assessment for each action
   - Support multiple remediation strategies

3. **Execution Modes**
   - Manual mode: Return recommendations only
   - Automatic mode: Execute approved remediations
   - Hybrid mode: Auto-execute low-risk, manual for high-risk

4. **Cluster Capability Discovery**
   - Include complete API resource list in investigation prompt from start (core + custom resources)
   - Operator-aware remediation recommendations based on all available APIs
   - Preference for sophisticated/operator-managed resources over basic alternatives
   - Smart resource selection based on complete cluster capability visibility

5. **Integration Points**
   - HTTP/JSON API for external callers
   - MCP protocol compliance
   - Structured response format

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Response within 10 seconds for analysis
- **Reliability**: 99.9% availability for critical path
- **Security**: Multi-layer safety for read-only operations during investigation
  - AI prompt constraints (explicit read-only instructions)
  - Code enforcement (whitelist of safe operations)
  - RBAC constraints (read-only service account)
  - Command validation (parameterized, safe command construction)
- **Audit**: Complete investigation trail and all remediation actions
- **Scalability**: Handle 100+ concurrent remediation requests

## Technical Design

### Tool Interface

```typescript

## Resolved Decisions

16. **✅ Rollback Capability Deferral**: Rollback implementation deferred from Milestone 2b
    - **Date**: 2025-09-19
    - **Decision**: Defer execution rollback capability to future milestone or separate implementation
    - **Rationale**: Core execution functionality is complete and working reliably; rollback adds complexity that may be better handled at orchestration layers (controllers, GitOps) rather than individual MCP tool level
    - **Impact**: Milestone 2b marked complete with core execution capabilities; rollback remains available as future enhancement
    - **Alternative Approaches**: Controllers can implement rollback logic, GitOps workflows provide natural rollback, manual intervention sufficient for current use cases
    - **Priority**: Low - not blocking production deployment of core remediation capabilities

17. **✅ Write Operation Safety Validation Deferral**: Separate write safety layer deemed unnecessary
    - **Date**: 2025-09-19
    - **Decision**: Defer/eliminate separate write operation safety validation layer
    - **Rationale**: Existing safety mechanisms are sufficient - manual mode provides explicit user approval for all operations, automatic mode has configurable thresholds (confidence & risk), users control their own safety level through mode selection and threshold configuration. Additional validation layer would be redundant and add unnecessary complexity.
    - **Impact**: Simplifies Milestone 2b scope, removes "Add write operation safety validation" task, focuses on audit logging as next priority
    - **Alternative Approaches**: Users wanting maximum safety use manual mode, users wanting automation configure appropriate thresholds, risk assessment already built into AI analysis
    - **Priority**: Decision finalized - task removed from scope

18. **✅ Rate Limiting and Circuit Breaker Deferral**: Global infrastructure concern, not tool-specific
    - **Date**: 2025-09-19
    - **Decision**: Defer rate limiting and circuit breaker implementation from Milestone 3 to global MCP/Claude integration level
    - **Rationale**: No evidence of actual rate limiting issues in practice; these concerns should be handled globally at MCP server or Claude integration level, not per-tool; violates YAGNI principle by adding complex infrastructure without observed failures; current error handling (try-catch blocks, iteration limits, timeouts) is sufficient for tool-level reliability
    - **Impact**: Significantly simplifies Milestone 3 scope, removes infrastructure complexity from tool implementation, shifts focus to actual observed issues rather than theoretical problems
    - **Alternative Approaches**: Global rate limiting at MCP server level, Claude integration-level circuit breakers, monitoring-based approach to identify actual bottlenecks
    - **Priority**: Decision finalized - removed from tool scope, may be addressed globally if needed

19. **✅ Comprehensive Error Handling Deferral**: Current error handling sufficient until production patterns emerge
    - **Date**: 2025-09-19
    - **Decision**: Defer comprehensive error handling enhancements from Milestone 3 until real production usage patterns are observed
    - **Rationale**: Current error handling is already robust with graceful degradation, try-catch blocks, iteration limits, and timeout handling; no production failures have been observed that would warrant complex recovery strategies; better to wait for real production usage patterns before over-engineering
    - **Impact**: Reduces complexity and maintenance burden, allows focus on actual production feedback rather than anticipated issues, keeps codebase lean and maintainable
    - **Alternative Approaches**: Monitor production usage for specific error patterns, implement targeted fixes for actual observed issues, use existing logging to identify improvement areas
    - **Priority**: Low - revisit only if production usage reveals specific error patterns requiring enhanced handling

20. **✅ Core Functionality Complete**: MVP functionality delivered with Milestones 2a/2b  
    - **Date**: 2025-09-19
    - **Decision**: Consider core remediation functionality complete with Milestones 2a/2b finished - tool is functionally complete but requires documentation before production deployment
    - **Rationale**: Tool successfully performs end-to-end remediation with automatic and manual modes, iterative remediation and validation workflows are working, comprehensive testing validates functionality, remaining items (webhooks, dashboards) are nice-to-haves not core requirements
    - **Impact**: Core remediation capabilities delivered and tested, but Milestone 4 (Documentation) is MANDATORY per CLAUDE.md requirements before PRD can be marked complete
    - **Alternative Approaches**: Deploy without documentation (rejected - violates CLAUDE.md requirements), defer documentation (rejected - documentation is not optional)
    - **Priority**: Functionality complete - documentation required for production readiness

21. **✅ Integration Responsibilities Moved to Generic Infrastructure**: Controller integration and testing moved to dedicated PRDs
    - **Date**: 2025-01-19
    - **Decision**: Move controller integration patterns and end-to-end testing from PRD 97 to separate infrastructure PRDs
    - **Rationale**: Controller integration is not remediation-specific - it benefits ALL tools equally. A generic REST API gateway (PRD #110) provides universal HTTP access for any client. Integration testing framework (PRD #111) provides comprehensive testing for all tools, not just remediation.
    - **Impact**: PRD 97 scope simplified and focused purely on remediation functionality. Integration concerns handled at platform level where they belong. Milestone 2c effectively complete with core integration needs addressed by generic infrastructure.
    - **Alternative Approaches**: Keep controller integration in remediation PRD (rejected - creates redundant work for each tool), implement controller integration per-tool (rejected - violates DRY principle)
    - **Priority**: Decision allows PRD 97 to be considered complete for production use while ensuring integration needs are met more comprehensively

1. **✅ Context Enrichment Strategy**: AI-driven investigation loop with read-only data gathering
   - **Date**: 2025-01-11
   - **Decision**: Use AI ↔ Code iteration loop for comprehensive analysis
   - **Rationale**: Quality-first approach, AI can reason about investigation paths that code cannot anticipate
   - **Impact**: Milestone restructure, enhanced analysis capabilities in M1

2. **✅ State Management**: Session-based persistence using file storage
   - **Date**: 2025-01-11  
   - **Decision**: Follow existing tool patterns (recommend tool) for session management
   - **Rationale**: Consistency with existing architecture, auditability, resumability
   - **Impact**: Investigation state persisted across iterations, complete audit trail

3. **✅ Safety Architecture**: Multi-layer read-only operation enforcement
   - **Date**: 2025-01-11
   - **Decision**: Implement 4-layer safety system for investigation phase
   - **Rationale**: Critical safety requirement to prevent accidental cluster modifications during analysis
   - **Impact**: Additional validation components, enhanced security requirements, RBAC constraints

4. **✅ Context Size Management**: Hybrid approach for preventing Claude API context overflow
   - **Date**: 2025-09-14
   - **Decision**: Implement proactive context management with progressive compression and emergency fallback
   - **Rationale**: Investigation loop with 20 iterations and full Kubernetes data can easily exceed 200k token limit, risking investigation failure
   - **Impact**: Additional Safe Data Gatherer requirements, complexity in session management, need for intelligent data prioritization
   - **Architecture**: Size estimation → Progressive compression → Smart truncation → Emergency reset if needed
   - **Implementation Strategy**: 
     - Proactive size estimation before each AI prompt (~4 chars ≈ 1 token)
     - Sliding window: Keep last 3 iterations in full detail, summarize older ones
     - Smart data truncation: Limit gathered Kubernetes data to ~1250 tokens per iteration
     - Emergency context reset: Create fresh context with only essential findings if limits exceeded
   - **Priority**: Must be implemented before real Kubernetes API integration to prevent runtime failures

5. **✅ Interactive vs Headless Execution Context**: Simplified context detection using boolean flag
   - **Date**: 2025-09-14
   - **Decision**: Use single `interactive` boolean instead of complex source categorization
   - **Rationale**: Core behavior difference is "can we prompt user?" - source details are audit trail only
   - **Impact**: Simplified interface, clearer behavioral contract, easier testing and validation
   - **Architecture**: `interactive: true` = MCP client can show prompts, `interactive: false` = headless/persistent approval

6. **✅ Smart Fallback Logic for Automatic Mode**: Confidence and risk-based safety mechanisms
   - **Date**: 2025-09-14
   - **Decision**: Automatic mode falls back to manual when analysis confidence or action risk exceeds thresholds
   - **Rationale**: Safety valve for headless environments prevents low-confidence or dangerous auto-execution
   - **Impact**: New parameters (confidenceThreshold, maxRiskLevel), enhanced safety for production deployment
   - **Architecture**: Auto mode → Check confidence/risk thresholds → Fallback to manual if exceeded → Use appropriate approval workflow

7. **✅ Simplified Tool Interface**: Remove unnecessary policy parameter
   - **Date**: 2025-09-14
   - **Decision**: Remove `policy` field from RemediateInput interface
   - **Rationale**: Field was confusing (name suggests Kubernetes policies) and didn't affect core behavior
   - **Impact**: Cleaner interface, reduced complexity, audit trail info can be captured via logging or issue description
   - **Architecture**: Trigger source information captured in logs rather than API interface

8. **✅ Notification Responsibility Moved to Controllers**: MCP tool provides data, controllers handle notifications
   - **Date**: 2025-09-14
   - **Decision**: Remove notification requirements from MCP tool scope, move to controller/caller responsibility
   - **Rationale**: Controllers have business context, persona-specific configuration, and operational awareness that MCP tool lacks
   - **Impact**: Simplified MCP tool scope, enhanced structured output requirements for external notification systems
   - **Architecture**: MCP tool returns comprehensive structured data, controllers/callers implement notification logic based on their context

9. **✅ AI-Powered Final Analysis Implementation Gap Identified**: Investigation complete but remediation generation is scaffolding
   - **Date**: 2025-09-14
   - **Decision**: Implement AI-powered remediation generation before execution decision logic
   - **Rationale**: Cannot make execution decisions about remediation actions until AI actually generates real remediation recommendations
   - **Impact**: Milestone 1 requires completion of `generateFinalAnalysis()` function with real AI integration
   - **Code Impact**: Replace scaffolding in `src/tools/remediate.ts:579` with actual AI analysis using Claude integration
   - **Priority**: Critical blocker for Milestone 2 execution capabilities

10. **✅ Execution Mode Behavior Clarification**: Simplified automatic vs manual execution model
    - **Date**: 2025-09-14
    - **Decision**: Automatic mode makes autonomous execute/don't-execute decisions without approval workflows
    - **Rationale**: Cleaner separation - manual mode expects follow-up approval, automatic mode returns final status
    - **Impact**: Simplified interface design, clearer behavioral contract for headless vs interactive contexts
    - **Architecture**: 
      - Manual mode: Always returns `pending_approval`/`awaiting_user_approval` status, expects follow-up
      - Automatic mode: Returns `success` (executed) or `failed` (with fallbackReason), no approval workflow
    - **Code Impact**: RemediateOutput interface and execution logic need updates to match simplified model

11. **✅ Interface Simplification**: Remove unnecessary approval orchestration complexity
    - **Date**: 2025-09-14
    - **Decision**: Eliminate `approvalOptions` (API endpoints, webhooks, CLI) from RemediateOutput interface
    - **Rationale**: Two distinct use cases don't need complex approval orchestration:
      - Manual mode: MCP client handles user prompts directly
      - Automatic mode: No approval needed - threshold-based execution decisions only
    - **Impact**: Significantly simplified interface, reduced implementation complexity, clearer separation of concerns
    - **Code Impact**: Remove `approvalOptions`, `approvalId` complexity from interface and implementation
    - **Architecture**: Let MCP clients handle user interaction, let controllers handle threshold-based automation

12. **✅ Client-Agent Output Structure Enhancement**: Restructured for better client consumption
    - **Date**: 2025-09-15
    - **Decision**: Enhanced RemediateOutput with structured instructions, metadata, and risk considerations
    - **Rationale**: Original output was too raw for client agents - needed clear action steps and guidance
    - **Impact**: Improved client-agent integration, clearer user experience, better actionable guidance
    - **Code Impact**: Updated RemediateOutput interface with instructions, metadata sections, simplified risk naming
    - **Architecture**: Client-friendly structure with numbered steps, risk considerations, and execution metadata

13. **✅ Cluster API Discovery Architecture**: Complete API visibility for intelligent resource selection
    - **Date**: 2025-09-15
    - **Decision**: Include complete cluster API resource list in investigation prompt from start instead of defaulting to basic Kubernetes
    - **Rationale**: Clusters often have sophisticated operators and extended APIs that should be preferred over basic deployments; complete visibility enables better decisions
    - **Impact**: Major enhancement to remediation quality - tool will recommend best available resources based on complete cluster capabilities
    - **Code Impact**: API discovery integration needed in investigation loop, complete API awareness in prompts
    - **Architecture**: 
      - **Upfront API Context**: Include complete `kubectl api-resources` output in investigation prompt (core + custom, ~100KB context)
      - **AI Resource Selection**: AI scans full API list to identify best resource types for the issue
      - **Schema Discovery**: AI queries specific resource schemas with `kubectl explain` when needed
      - **Smart Preference**: Choose sophisticated/operator-managed resources over basic alternatives based on complete visibility
    - **Priority**: High - addresses root cause of suboptimal remediation recommendations (basic deployment vs operator-managed resources)

14. **✅ Schema Validation and Validation Workflow Implementation**: Enhanced remediation accuracy and post-fix validation
    - **Date**: 2025-09-15
    - **Decision**: Implement kubectl schema validation and post-remediation validation workflow to prevent invalid remediation commands and ensure fixes work
    - **Rationale**: AI was generating invalid kubectl commands due to lack of resource schema knowledge, and no validation workflow existed to verify fixes worked
    - **Impact**: Major enhancement to remediation quality and user experience - prevents schema errors and provides complete remediation cycle
    - **Code Impact**: 
      - Added `explain` to SAFE_OPERATIONS for schema discovery
      - Fixed dry-run validation parsing bug that prevented validation execution
      - Added `validationIntent` field to AI responses for post-remediation validation
      - Updated investigation prompts with schema validation guidance and cluster-first approach
    - **Architecture**: 
      - **Schema Validation**: AI uses `kubectl explain` to understand resource schemas before generating patches
      - **Dry-run Safety**: Fixed parsing to ensure dry-run validation executes during investigation
      - **Validation Workflow**: AI provides `validationIntent` for post-remediation verification with structured user guidance
      - **Cluster-First Design**: Tool focuses on existing cluster resources, never suggests external installations
    - **Evidence**: Successfully remediated SQL resource with schema-validated patches, all 919 tests passing
    - **Priority**: Complete - addresses critical usability and accuracy issues

15. **✅ GitOps-Friendly Full Resource Output**: Enhanced remediation output for Infrastructure as Code workflows
    - **Date**: 2025-01-15  
    - **Decision**: Add complete modified YAML resources to remediation action output alongside existing kubectl commands
    - **Rationale**: Many organizations use GitOps (ArgoCD, Flux) and need full resource definitions to commit to Git rather than applying patches directly
    - **Impact**: Enables remediation suggestions to flow through Infrastructure as Code workflows while maintaining existing direct execution option
    - **Code Impact**: 
      - Add optional `yaml` field to existing `RemediationAction` interface containing complete modified resources
      - Use `---` separator for multiple resources in single YAML output
      - Update MCP output instructions to mention YAML save option for client agents
      - Maintain all existing fields (description, command, risk, rationale) unchanged
