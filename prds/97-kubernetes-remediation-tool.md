# PRD: Kubernetes Remediation Tool

**Issue**: #97  
**Created**: 2025-01-10  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Priority**: High  
**Owner**: TBD  

## Executive Summary

Add a new MCP tool called `remediate` that receives Kubernetes issues and events, analyzes them using AI, and provides remediation recommendations or executes fixes. This tool will be callable from multiple sources including Kubernetes controllers, human agents via Claude Code, and CI/CD pipelines.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
- Kubernetes operational issues require manual intervention, increasing MTTR
- No standardized approach to common cluster problems
- Knowledge of fixes is distributed across team members
- Repetitive issues consume significant operational time
- Lack of automated response to predictable failures

### User Impact
- **DevOps Teams**: Spend excessive time on repetitive incident response
- **On-call Engineers**: Face alert fatigue from issues that could be auto-remediated
- **Platform Teams**: Struggle to maintain consistent remediation practices across clusters

## Success Criteria

- Reduce MTTR for common Kubernetes issues by 50%
- Successfully auto-remediate 80% of targeted event types
- Provide actionable recommendations for 95% of analyzed issues
- Support both automated and manual approval workflows
- Zero false-positive remediations that cause service degradation

## Scope

### In Scope
- New MCP tool (`remediate`) for issue analysis and remediation
- AI-powered analysis using existing Claude integration
- Support for multiple trigger sources (controller, human, API)
- Manual and automatic remediation modes
- Structured remediation reporting and audit trails

### Out of Scope
- Kubernetes controller implementation (separate project - future PRD)
- Notification systems and delivery mechanisms (controller/caller responsibility)
- Multi-cluster orchestration (future enhancement)
- Custom resource definitions (controller project)
- Event watching and filtering (controller responsibility)
- Business context and persona-specific configuration (controller responsibility)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Issue Analysis**
   - Accept structured issue descriptions with context
   - Analyze logs, metrics, and related events
   - Identify root causes using AI

2. **Remediation Generation**
   - Generate specific remediation steps
   - Provide risk assessment for each action
   - Support multiple remediation strategies

3. **Execution Modes**
   - Manual mode: Return recommendations only
   - Automatic mode: Execute approved remediations
   - Hybrid mode: Auto-execute low-risk, manual for high-risk

4. **Integration Points**
   - HTTP/JSON API for external callers
   - MCP protocol compliance
   - Structured response format

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Response within 10 seconds for analysis
- **Reliability**: 99.9% availability for critical path
- **Security**: Multi-layer safety for read-only operations during investigation
  - AI prompt constraints (explicit read-only instructions)
  - Code enforcement (whitelist of safe operations)
  - RBAC constraints (read-only service account)
  - Command validation (parameterized, safe command construction)
- **Audit**: Complete investigation trail and all remediation actions
- **Scalability**: Handle 100+ concurrent remediation requests

## Technical Design

## Dependencies

- Existing Claude AI integration
- Kubernetes API access with appropriate RBAC
- MCP server infrastructure
- Session storage system (for state management)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Pattern Learning**: Learn from successful remediations
2. **Custom Remediation Scripts**: User-defined fix procedures
3. **Multi-cluster Support**: Coordinate fixes across clusters
4. **Predictive Remediation**: Fix issues before they occur
5. **Integration Marketplace**: Pre-built integrations with monitoring tools

## Open Questions

1. **RBAC Configuration**: Specific permissions needed for read-only service account - finalize during implementation
2. **Session Cleanup**: Retention policy for investigation session files - determine based on storage constraints
3. **Webhook Integration Details**: Specific approval webhook formats and integrations - determine based on user feedback during Milestone 2c
4. **Execution Rollback Scope**: Granularity of rollback capabilities for different action types - determine during Milestone 2b implementation
5. **Production Monitoring**: Specific metrics and alerting requirements for execution pipeline - determine during Milestone 2c

## Resolved Decisions

1. **✅ Context Enrichment Strategy**: AI-driven investigation loop with read-only data gathering
   - **Date**: 2025-01-11
   - **Decision**: Use AI ↔ Code iteration loop for comprehensive analysis
   - **Rationale**: Quality-first approach, AI can reason about investigation paths that code cannot anticipate
   - **Impact**: Milestone restructure, enhanced analysis capabilities in M1

2. **✅ State Management**: Session-based persistence using file storage
   - **Date**: 2025-01-11  
   - **Decision**: Follow existing tool patterns (recommend tool) for session management
   - **Rationale**: Consistency with existing architecture, auditability, resumability
   - **Impact**: Investigation state persisted across iterations, complete audit trail

3. **✅ Safety Architecture**: Multi-layer read-only operation enforcement
   - **Date**: 2025-01-11
   - **Decision**: Implement 4-layer safety system for investigation phase
   - **Rationale**: Critical safety requirement to prevent accidental cluster modifications during analysis
   - **Impact**: Additional validation components, enhanced security requirements, RBAC constraints

4. **✅ Context Size Management**: Hybrid approach for preventing Claude API context overflow
   - **Date**: 2025-09-14
   - **Decision**: Implement proactive context management with progressive compression and emergency fallback
   - **Rationale**: Investigation loop with 20 iterations and full Kubernetes data can easily exceed 200k token limit, risking investigation failure
   - **Impact**: Additional Safe Data Gatherer requirements, complexity in session management, need for intelligent data prioritization
   - **Architecture**: Size estimation → Progressive compression → Smart truncation → Emergency reset if needed
   - **Implementation Strategy**: 
     - Proactive size estimation before each AI prompt (~4 chars ≈ 1 token)
     - Sliding window: Keep last 3 iterations in full detail, summarize older ones
     - Smart data truncation: Limit gathered Kubernetes data to ~1250 tokens per iteration
     - Emergency context reset: Create fresh context with only essential findings if limits exceeded
   - **Priority**: Must be implemented before real Kubernetes API integration to prevent runtime failures

5. **✅ Interactive vs Headless Execution Context**: Simplified context detection using boolean flag
   - **Date**: 2025-09-14
   - **Decision**: Use single `interactive` boolean instead of complex source categorization
   - **Rationale**: Core behavior difference is "can we prompt user?" - source details are audit trail only
   - **Impact**: Simplified interface, clearer behavioral contract, easier testing and validation
   - **Architecture**: `interactive: true` = MCP client can show prompts, `interactive: false` = headless/persistent approval

6. **✅ Smart Fallback Logic for Automatic Mode**: Confidence and risk-based safety mechanisms
   - **Date**: 2025-09-14
   - **Decision**: Automatic mode falls back to manual when analysis confidence or action risk exceeds thresholds
   - **Rationale**: Safety valve for headless environments prevents low-confidence or dangerous auto-execution
   - **Impact**: New parameters (confidenceThreshold, maxRiskLevel), enhanced safety for production deployment
   - **Architecture**: Auto mode → Check confidence/risk thresholds → Fallback to manual if exceeded → Use appropriate approval workflow

7. **✅ Simplified Tool Interface**: Remove unnecessary policy parameter
   - **Date**: 2025-09-14
   - **Decision**: Remove `policy` field from RemediateInput interface
   - **Rationale**: Field was confusing (name suggests Kubernetes policies) and didn't affect core behavior
   - **Impact**: Cleaner interface, reduced complexity, audit trail info can be captured via logging or issue description
   - **Architecture**: Trigger source information captured in logs rather than API interface

8. **✅ Notification Responsibility Moved to Controllers**: MCP tool provides data, controllers handle notifications
   - **Date**: 2025-09-14
   - **Decision**: Remove notification requirements from MCP tool scope, move to controller/caller responsibility
   - **Rationale**: Controllers have business context, persona-specific configuration, and operational awareness that MCP tool lacks
   - **Impact**: Simplified MCP tool scope, enhanced structured output requirements for external notification systems
   - **Architecture**: MCP tool returns comprehensive structured data, controllers/callers implement notification logic based on their context
