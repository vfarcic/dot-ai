# PRD: Kubernetes Remediation Tool

**Issue**: #97  
**Created**: 2025-01-10  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Priority**: High  
**Owner**: TBD  

## Executive Summary

Add a new MCP tool called `remediate` that receives Kubernetes issues and events, analyzes them using AI, and provides remediation recommendations or executes fixes. This tool will be callable from multiple sources including Kubernetes controllers, human agents via Claude Code, and CI/CD pipelines.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
- Kubernetes operational issues require manual intervention, increasing MTTR
- No standardized approach to common cluster problems
- Knowledge of fixes is distributed across team members
- Repetitive issues consume significant operational time
- Lack of automated response to predictable failures

### User Impact
- **DevOps Teams**: Spend excessive time on repetitive incident response
- **On-call Engineers**: Face alert fatigue from issues that could be auto-remediated
- **Platform Teams**: Struggle to maintain consistent remediation practices across clusters

## Success Criteria

- Reduce MTTR for common Kubernetes issues by 50%
- Successfully auto-remediate 80% of targeted event types
- Provide actionable recommendations for 95% of analyzed issues
- Support both automated and manual approval workflows
- Zero false-positive remediations that cause service degradation

## Scope

### In Scope
- New MCP tool (`remediate`) for issue analysis and remediation
- AI-powered analysis using existing Claude integration
- Support for multiple trigger sources (controller, human, API)
- Manual and automatic remediation modes
- Structured remediation reporting and audit trails

### Out of Scope
- Kubernetes controller implementation (separate project)
- Notification/approval mechanisms (deferred to implementation phase)
- Multi-cluster orchestration (future enhancement)
- Custom resource definitions (controller project)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Issue Analysis**
   - Accept structured issue descriptions with context
   - Analyze logs, metrics, and related events
   - Identify root causes using AI

2. **Remediation Generation**
   - Generate specific remediation steps
   - Provide risk assessment for each action
   - Support multiple remediation strategies

3. **Execution Modes**
   - Manual mode: Return recommendations only
   - Automatic mode: Execute approved remediations
   - Hybrid mode: Auto-execute low-risk, manual for high-risk

4. **Integration Points**
   - HTTP/JSON API for external callers
   - MCP protocol compliance
   - Structured response format

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Response within 10 seconds for analysis
- **Reliability**: 99.9% availability for critical path
- **Security**: Audit all remediation actions
- **Scalability**: Handle 100+ concurrent remediation requests

## Technical Design

### Tool Interface

```typescript
interface RemediateInput {
  issue: string;           // Issue description
  context?: {             // Optional context
    event?: K8sEvent;
    logs?: string[];
    metrics?: Metrics;
    podSpec?: any;
    relatedEvents?: K8sEvent[];
  };
  mode?: 'manual' | 'automatic';
  policy?: string;        // Reference to calling policy
}

interface RemediateOutput {
  status: 'success' | 'pending' | 'failed';
  sessionId: string;
  analysis: {
    rootCause: string;
    confidence: number;
    factors: string[];
  };
  remediation: {
    summary: string;
    actions: RemediationAction[];
    risk: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  };
  executed?: boolean;
  results?: ExecutionResult[];
}
```

### Architecture Integration

```
External Callers → MCP Server → Remediate Tool → Claude AI
                                      ↓
                                 Kubernetes API
```

### Key Components

1. **Tool Handler** (`src/tools/remediate.ts`)
   - Input validation
   - Context enrichment
   - AI prompt construction

2. **Remediation Engine**
   - Action generation
   - Risk assessment
   - Execution orchestration

3. **Audit Logger**
   - Track all decisions
   - Record execution results
   - Compliance reporting

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| AI generates incorrect remediation | High | Medium | Manual approval for high-risk actions, extensive testing |
| Remediation causes cascade failure | High | Low | Circuit breakers, gradual rollout, automatic rollback |
| Performance degradation under load | Medium | Medium | Rate limiting, queue management, horizontal scaling |
| Integration complexity with controllers | Medium | Low | Well-defined interface contract, extensive documentation |

## Dependencies

- Existing Claude AI integration
- Kubernetes API access with appropriate RBAC
- MCP server infrastructure
- Session storage system (for state management)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Pattern Learning**: Learn from successful remediations
2. **Custom Remediation Scripts**: User-defined fix procedures
3. **Multi-cluster Support**: Coordinate fixes across clusters
4. **Predictive Remediation**: Fix issues before they occur
5. **Integration Marketplace**: Pre-built integrations with monitoring tools

## Open Questions

1. **Approval Mechanism**: Slack vs UI vs webhook - to be determined during implementation
2. **State Storage**: CRD vs external database - defer until state requirements clear
3. **Notification Channels**: Specific integrations to be determined based on user feedback
4. **Rate Limiting Strategy**: Adaptive vs fixed - determine based on load testing

## Progress Log

### 2025-01-10
- Initial PRD created based on architectural discussions
- Core concept validated with stakeholder
- Decision to separate controller and MCP tool implementation
- Defined interface contract between components
