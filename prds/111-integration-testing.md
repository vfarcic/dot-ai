# PRD: Integration Testing Framework for DevOps AI Toolkit

**Issue**: #111  
**Created**: 2025-01-19  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Owner**: TBD  

## Executive Summary

Build a comprehensive integration testing framework that validates all dot-ai tools work correctly with real Kubernetes clusters and external dependencies. This framework leverages the REST API gateway to provide simple HTTP-based testing that can run in CI/CD pipelines and local development environments.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
- Testing relies primarily on unit tests with mocked dependencies
- No validation that tools work correctly with real Kubernetes clusters
- Difficult to test complex scenarios involving multiple tools and dependencies
- Manual testing required for each release to verify functionality
- No automated regression testing for tool integrations
- Integration issues discovered late in development cycle

### User Impact
- **Development Teams**: Risk of shipping bugs that only appear in real environments
- **QA Teams**: Manual testing burden for complex integration scenarios
- **Platform Teams**: Lack of confidence in tool reliability for production use
- **Contributors**: Difficulty testing changes without complex local setup

## Success Criteria

- All dot-ai tools have comprehensive integration tests
- Tests run automatically in CI/CD pipeline
- Test suite covers real Kubernetes cluster interactions
- Failed tests provide actionable debugging information
- Test execution time under 15 minutes for full suite
- Easy to add tests for new tools without framework changes

## Scope

### In Scope
- HTTP-based integration tests using REST API gateway
- Real Kubernetes cluster integration (test clusters)
- Test data management and cleanup
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Test reporting and failure analysis
- Coverage tracking for tool functionality
- Local development testing support

### Out of Scope
- Unit test replacement (integration tests complement, not replace)
- Performance/load testing (separate initiative)
- Security penetration testing (separate security initiative)
- Multi-cluster testing scenarios (single cluster focus)
- Production environment testing (test clusters only)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Tool Test Coverage**
   - Integration tests for all existing tools (recommend, remediate, deploy, etc.)
   - Tests cover primary use cases and error scenarios
   - Validation of tool outputs and side effects
   - Cross-tool interaction testing where applicable

2. **Kubernetes Integration**
   - Tests run against real Kubernetes clusters
   - Automatic test cluster setup and teardown
   - Test namespace isolation and cleanup
   - Kubernetes resource lifecycle testing

3. **Test Data Management**
   - Reusable test fixtures and scenarios
   - Automatic cleanup of test resources
   - Test data versioning and consistency
   - Parameterized tests for different configurations

4. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Tests run on every pull request
   - Clear pass/fail reporting
   - Integration with existing GitHub Actions
   - Test results available in PR status checks

5. **Local Development**
   - Easy test execution for developers
   - Fast feedback loop for test failures
   - Minimal setup requirements
   - Clear documentation for running tests

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Full test suite completes within 15 minutes
- **Reliability**: Tests pass consistently with <1% flake rate
- **Maintainability**: New tools automatically included in test framework
- **Debuggability**: Clear error messages and logs for test failures
- **Isolation**: Tests don't interfere with each other or external systems

## Technical Design

### Architecture Overview

```
GitHub Actions → Test Runner → REST API Gateway → dot-ai Tools → Test Kubernetes Cluster
                      ↓              ↓                ↓                    ↓
                Test Reports ← Result Validation ← Tool Responses ← Cluster State
```

### Core Components

1. **Test Framework** (`tests/integration/`)
   - HTTP client for REST API gateway
   - Kubernetes client for cluster validation
   - Test utilities and helpers
   - Assertion and validation libraries

2. **Test Suites** (`tests/integration/tools/`)
   - Individual test files for each tool
   - Common test patterns and scenarios
   - Error case and edge case coverage
   - Cross-tool integration scenarios

3. **Test Infrastructure** (`tests/integration/infrastructure/`)
   - Kubernetes cluster management
   - Test namespace setup/teardown
   - Resource cleanup utilities
   - Test data fixtures

4. **CI/CD Integration** (`.github/workflows/`)
   - Integration test workflow
   - Test cluster provisioning
   - Test result reporting
   - Artifact collection and storage

### Test Execution Flow

1. **Setup Phase**
   - Provision/configure test Kubernetes cluster
   - Deploy dot-ai with REST API gateway
   - Create test namespaces and base resources

2. **Test Execution**
   - Run tool-specific integration tests
   - Validate responses and cluster state
   - Execute cross-tool scenarios
   - Collect logs and artifacts

3. **Cleanup Phase**
   - Clean up test resources
   - Collect final logs and metrics
   - Generate test reports
   - Tear down test infrastructure

### Example Test Structure

```typescript
// tests/integration/tools/remediate.test.ts
describe('Remediate Tool Integration', () => {
  test('fixes crashloop pod with real cluster', async () => {
    // Setup: Create failing pod
    await k8s.createPod(crashLoopPodSpec);
    
    // Execute: Call remediate tool via REST API
    const response = await http.post('/api/v1/tools/remediate', {
      issue: 'Pod crashloop-test is in CrashLoopBackOff',
      mode: 'automatic'
    });
    
    // Validate: Check response and cluster state
    expect(response.status).toBe('success');
    expect(response.remediation.actions).toBeDefined();
    
    // Verify: Pod actually gets fixed
    const pod = await k8s.getPod('crashloop-test');
    expect(pod.status.phase).toBe('Running');
  });
});
```

| Test flakiness due to timing issues | Medium | High | Robust retry logic, proper wait conditions, isolated test environments |
| CI/CD pipeline performance issues | Medium | Medium | Parallel test execution, test result caching, incremental testing |
| Test maintenance overhead | Medium | Medium | Auto-generated test scaffolding, clear test patterns, good documentation |

## Dependencies

2. **Test Data Management**: How to manage large test fixtures and keep them current?
3. **Parallel Execution**: How to safely run tests in parallel without conflicts?
4. **Test Environment Parity**: How closely should test environment match production?
