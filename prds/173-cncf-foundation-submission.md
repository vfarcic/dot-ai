## Problem Statement

DevOps AI Toolkit has achieved technical maturity and initial adoption (147 stars, 28 forks, 442 commits in 6 months) but lacks the ecosystem presence, neutral governance structure, and community resources needed for long-term sustainability and widespread adoption in the cloud native ecosystem.

### Current State
- **Project Maturity**: Active development with 442 commits in 6 months, primarily single maintainer (Viktor Farcic)
- **Adoption**: 147 GitHub stars, 28 forks, 7 watchers - showing early interest but limited production evidence
- **Community**: Limited contributor base (3 contributors: Viktor Farcic, GitHub Action, renovate[bot])
- **Governance**: Informal governance under single maintainer/copyright holder
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Builds on Kubernetes, MCP, and AI providers but not part of CNCF ecosystem

### Problems to Solve
1. **Limited Visibility**: Project unknown to broader cloud native community
2. **Single Point of Failure**: Heavy dependence on single maintainer creates sustainability risk
3. **Governance Gaps**: Missing formal governance, contribution guidelines, security policies
4. **Community Growth**: Need structured approach to attract contributors and adopters
5. **Ecosystem Isolation**: Not recognized as part of cloud native ecosystem despite deep integration

---

## Proposed Solution

Submit DevOps AI Toolkit to CNCF Sandbox level, establishing the project as a recognized cloud native initiative with access to CNCF resources, community, and governance frameworks.

### CNCF Sandbox Overview
- **Purpose**: Entry point for early-stage innovative projects
- **Benefits**: Visibility, neutral governance foundation, CNCF infrastructure, legal/trademark support
- **Timeline**: Applications reviewed every 2 months, 7-10 projects per session
- **Success Rate**: 13 projects accepted in H2 2024 alone

### Why Sandbox (Not Incubating/Graduated)
- **Right fit for maturity level**: Experimental/innovative with growing but limited adoption
- **Community building time**: Sandbox provides runway to attract contributors and production users
- **Governance development**: Time to establish formal governance before incubation requirements

## Pre-Implementation Decisions

Before starting Milestone 1, these key decisions need to be made:

### Decision 1: Website URL Strategy
**Required for**: Application Form Field #6
**Options**:
- Use GitHub repository URL as website (simplest, common for Sandbox)
- Create GitHub Pages site
- Create dedicated project website

**Decision**: ✅ **Use GitHub repository URL** (https://github.com/vfarcic/dot-ai)
**Rationale**: Standard for CNCF Sandbox projects, zero setup time, comprehensive README serves as homepage, can upgrade post-acceptance

---

### Decision 2: Community Communication Channel
**Required for**: Milestone 3 deliverable, impacts CONTRIBUTING.md content
**Options**:
- GitHub Discussions (lightweight, integrated)
- CNCF Slack channel (requires acceptance first)
- Discord server
- No separate channel initially (GitHub Issues only)

**Decision**: ✅ **GitHub Discussions**
**Rationale**: Free, integrated with GitHub, searchable, standard for CNCF Sandbox projects, can add CNCF Slack after acceptance
**Action Required**: Enable GitHub Discussions in repository settings

---

### Decision 3: TAG Assignment Strategy
**Required for**: Application Form Field #27
**Options**:
- Request TAG-App-Delivery (best fit for deployment tool)
- Request TAG-Runtime
- Request TAG-Contributor-Strategy
- Let TOC assign automatically

**Decision**: ✅ **Let TOC assign automatically**
**Rationale**: Project scope is broader than single TAG domain (covers app deployment, infrastructure management, remediation, platform engineering). TOC has full context from application and can assign to most appropriate TAG (likely TAG-Runtime or TAG-App-Delivery)

## Open Questions

1. **TAG Assignment**: Which TAG should review this project? (Likely TAG-App-Delivery, but could be TAG-Runtime or TAG-Contributor-Strategy)

2. **Project Positioning**: Position as "AI-powered Kubernetes deployment tool" or broader "DevOps AI platform"? This affects competitive landscape analysis.

3. **Trademark Status**: Does "DevOps AI Toolkit" have any trademark registration? Need clarity for application.

4. **Production Adopters**: Can we identify any production users to strengthen application? Even informal usage counts.

5. **Maintainer Expansion**: Should we recruit additional maintainers before submission to show community growth potential?

6. **Name Considerations**: Does "DevOps AI Toolkit" conflict with any existing CNCF projects? Should we consider name alternatives?

7. **Timing Strategy**: Submit immediately when ready, or wait for specific TOC review cycle? (~every 2 months)

8. **Community Channels**: Set up Slack workspace, Discord server, or use GitHub Discussions? What's minimum viable community infrastructure?
