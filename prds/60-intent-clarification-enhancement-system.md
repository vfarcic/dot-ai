# PRD #60: Intent Clarification and Enhancement System

**GitHub Issue**: [#60](https://github.com/vfarcic/dot-ai/issues/60)  
**Status**: Draft  
**Priority**: High  
**Owner**: TBD  

## Problem Statement

Users frequently provide vague or incomplete intents that result in generic solution recommendations that don't match their actual requirements. The current system generates solutions based on limited information, leading to suboptimal recommendations and requiring multiple iterations to achieve desired outcomes.

**Current Broken User Experience**:
- **User Input**: "create postgresql database in Azure"
- **System Output**: 5 generic PostgreSQL solutions without understanding specific needs
- **Missing Context**: Schema management requirements, accessibility needs, performance expectations, compliance requirements
- **Result**: User must manually evaluate solutions that may not fit their actual use case

**Impact on User Journey**:
- **Time Waste**: Users spend time reviewing irrelevant solutions
- **Poor Matches**: Solutions don't align with actual technical requirements  
- **Iterative Frustration**: Multiple rounds of refinement to get suitable recommendations
- **Missed Opportunities**: System doesn't leverage organizational patterns effectively

## Success Criteria

### Primary Objectives
1. **Enhanced Intent Quality** - Users provide more specific, actionable intents through guided clarification
2. **Better Solution Relevance** - Solutions closely match user's actual requirements and constraints
3. **Improved User Confidence** - Users feel confident their needs are understood before seeing solutions
4. **Faster Time to Value** - Reduced iterations between intent and acceptable solution
5. **Pattern Leverage** - Organizational patterns inform question generation for better governance

### Validation Test Cases
- **Vague Database Request** → Specific questions about schema, accessibility, compliance → Enhanced intent → Targeted solutions
- **Generic Web App Request** → Questions about architecture, scaling, security → Enhanced intent → Appropriate solutions
- **API Deployment Request** → Questions about authentication, rate limiting, integrations → Enhanced intent → Relevant solutions

### Success Metrics
1. **Question Engagement Rate** - % of users who answer at least one clarification question
2. **Enhanced Intent Adoption** - % of users who proceed with enhanced vs. original intent
3. **Solution Selection Confidence** - User satisfaction with recommended solutions
4. **Reduced Iteration Rate** - Fewer cycles between recommendation and final deployment
5. **Pattern Application Improvement** - Better alignment with organizational patterns

## Work Log

### 2025-08-14 - Phase 1: Core Intent Analysis Implementation ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Milestone: Core Intent Analysis and Question Generation**
- [x] **Design intent analysis prompt** - Created comprehensive AI template in `prompts/intent-analysis.md`
- [x] **Implement question generation AI service** - Added `analyzeIntentForClarification()` method to Claude service
- [x] **Create question formatting system** - Implemented structured response with categories, impact levels, and suggested questions
- [x] **Integrate organizational pattern context** - Template supports organizational patterns for informed question generation
- [x] **Add question quality validation** - Robust error handling with fallback responses

**Key Implementation Decisions:**
- **Single-tool approach**: Extended existing `recommend` tool with `final: boolean` parameter instead of separate clarification tool
- **User-centric design**: System provides clarification questions for user consideration rather than AI-enhanced intents
- **Stateless architecture**: No session tracking needed - `final: true` indicates user has considered clarification
- **Graceful degradation**: System continues with original intent if analysis fails

**Technical Architecture:**
```typescript
// Phase 1: Analysis (default)
recommend({ intent: "deploy web app" })
// Returns: { status: "clarification_available", questions: [...], agentInstructions: "..." }

// Phase 2: Final recommendation 
recommend({ intent: "deploy Node.js web app with PostgreSQL", final: true })
// Proceeds with normal recommendation flow
```

**Replaced Legacy System:**
- ❌ Removed binary intent validation (`validateIntentWithAI`)
- ❌ Removed `prompts/intent-validation.md`
- ✅ Added comprehensive intent analysis system
- ✅ Updated all tests to match new approach

**Deliverables Completed:**
- ✅ Working intent analysis system generating meaningful clarification questions
- ✅ Integration with existing MCP tool infrastructure
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage with updated test suite
- ✅ Clean removal of unused validation code

### 2025-08-14 - Phase 2: Complete Clarification Workflow + Comprehensive Testing ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Milestone: Client Agent Integration and Comprehensive Test Coverage**

**Key Implementation Decisions:**
- **Complete Phase 2 via recommend tool extension**: Rather than create separate tools, we extended the existing `recommend` tool with `final: boolean` parameter
- **Stateless workflow**: Client agents use `final: true` to indicate user has considered clarification
- **Comprehensive error handling**: System gracefully degrades when AI analysis fails
- **No real API usage in tests**: All 32 new tests use mocking patterns following existing conventions

**Phase 2 Tasks Completed:**
- [x] **Create intent clarification MCP tool** - Extended recommend tool with clarification workflow integrated
- [x] **Design question presentation format** - Structured JSON response with questions, categories, reasoning, and agent instructions
- [x] **Implement answer collection system** - Client agents receive clear instructions and call recommend tool with refined intent
- [x] **Add skip/proceed functionality** - `final: true` parameter allows users to bypass clarification entirely
- [x] **Create progress indicators** - Status fields and agent instructions provide all information needed for client progress display

**Comprehensive Test Coverage Added:**
- **17 new Claude service tests** - Complete coverage of `analyzeIntentForClarification()` method
  - JSON parsing with/without code blocks
  - Organizational pattern integration
  - Error handling and fallback scenarios
  - Response structure validation
- **15 new recommend tool tests** - Schema validation, type signatures, workflow integration
- **All tests pass** - 35 test suites, 782 total tests, 0 failures
- **No real AI API usage** - Following existing test-key mocking patterns

**Technical Architecture Completed:**
```typescript
// Working end-to-end workflow:
// Phase 1: Clarification (when final not set)
recommend({ intent: "deploy web app" })
// Returns: { status: "clarification_available", questions: [...], agentInstructions: "..." }

// Phase 2: Recommendations (when user provides final intent)
recommend({ intent: "deploy Node.js web app with PostgreSQL", final: true })
// Proceeds with normal recommendation pipeline
```

**Integration Points Delivered:**
- ✅ Extended recommend tool maintains backward compatibility
- ✅ Client agents receive structured questions and clear instructions
- ✅ Graceful fallback when analysis fails or no opportunities found
- ✅ Seamless integration with existing recommendation pipeline

**Deliverables Completed:**
- ✅ Complete working clarification workflow from intent → questions → refined recommendations
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage protecting against regressions  
- ✅ Production-ready error handling and edge case management
- ✅ Client agent integration ready for real-world usage
