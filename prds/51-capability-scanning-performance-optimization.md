# PRD-51: Capability Scanning Performance Optimization

**GitHub Issue**: [#51](https://github.com/vfarcic/dot-ai/issues/51)  
**Status**: Planning  
**Created**: 2025-01-08  
**Owner**: TBD  

## Executive Summary

Cluster capability scanning is currently a performance bottleneck that impacts user experience with AI recommendations. Users must wait for initial capability scans to complete before they can access recommendation features, creating friction in the user journey. This PRD focuses on optimizing capability scanning performance to reduce wait times and improve overall system responsiveness.

## Problem Statement

### Current State
- Initial capability scanning is required before users can access AI-powered recommendations
- Scanning performance creates noticeable delays in user workflows
- Performance bottlenecks may discourage adoption of recommendation features
- Current scanning approach may not scale efficiently with cluster size or resource count

### Impact
- **User Experience**: Delayed access to core recommendation functionality
- **Adoption**: Performance friction may reduce feature adoption
- **Scalability**: Current approach may not handle large clusters efficiently
- **System Resources**: Inefficient scanning may consume unnecessary compute/API resources

### Success Criteria
- Measurably faster capability scanning times
- Improved user experience during initial setup and rescanning operations
- Better resource utilization during scanning operations
- Maintained accuracy and completeness of capability discovery

## Solution Overview

This PRD focuses on optimizing the capability scanning pipeline to achieve significant performance improvements. The exact optimization strategies will be determined during implementation based on profiling and analysis of current bottlenecks.

### Approach
- Analyze current scanning performance bottlenecks
- Implement evidence-based optimizations
- Maintain compatibility with existing capability data structures
- Ensure no regression in scanning accuracy or completeness

### Out of Scope
- Changes to capability data models or storage formats
- Modifications to recommendation algorithms that consume capability data
- Broader cluster discovery optimizations beyond capability scanning
