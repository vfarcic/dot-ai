# PRD 155: Parallel Capability Analysis

**GitHub Issue**: [#155](https://github.com/vfarcic/dot-ai/issues/155)  
**Status**: Planning  
**Priority**: High  
**Created**: 2025-10-12  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-12

## Problem Statement

Current capability scanning processes Kubernetes resources sequentially, with each AI-powered capability inference taking 4-6 seconds. For a typical cluster scan of 66 resources, this results in 4-6 minutes of processing time, creating poor user experience and limiting scalability for larger environments.

**Impact Analysis:**

- **User Experience**: Long wait times discourage usage of capability scanning features
- **Scalability**: Sequential processing doesn't scale for enterprise environments with hundreds of CRDs
- **Resource Utilization**: Underutilizes available AI provider capacity and system resources
- **Development Efficiency**: Slow feedback loops during testing and development

## Solution Overview

Implement parallel processing of capability analysis with intelligent concurrency management, thread-safe session handling, and real-time progress tracking. Replace the current sequential for-loop with a parallel processing architecture that can reduce scanning time by 10x while maintaining reliability and user visibility.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Performance**: 10x faster capability scanning (5+ minutes → 30-60 seconds)
- **Scalability**: Handle enterprise-scale clusters efficiently
- **User Experience**: Real-time progress updates during parallel processing
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimal utilization of AI provider capacity

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
- [ ] **Performance Improvement**: Capability scanning completes 8-10x faster than current implementation
- [ ] **Reliability**: Zero data corruption or lost updates during parallel processing
- [ ] **Progress Visibility**: Users see real-time updates as individual resources complete
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Failed resources don't block processing of other resources

### Secondary Success Metrics
- [ ] **Rate Limit Compliance**: No AI provider rate limit violations during parallel execution
- [ ] **Memory Efficiency**: Parallel processing uses acceptable memory footprint
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: All existing capability tests pass with parallel implementation
- [ ] **User Feedback**: Positive user experience with faster scanning workflow

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **DevOps Engineers**: Scanning large clusters for capability discovery and inventory
- **Platform Engineers**: Analyzing organizational resource patterns across multiple environments
- **Development Teams**: Quick capability assessment during testing and validation

### Use Cases
- **Cluster Onboarding**: Fast capability discovery for new environments

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Parallel Processing Engine
- Replace sequential for-loop with Promise-based parallel execution
- Configurable concurrency limits (default: 5-10 concurrent requests)
- Intelligent error handling with Promise.allSettled

#### 2. Thread-Safe Session Management
- Atomic session file updates with file locking mechanism
- Temp file + rename pattern for atomic writes
- Session update queuing to prevent race conditions

#### 3. Real-Time Progress Tracking
- Event-driven progress updates as resources complete
- Detailed tracking: in-progress, completed, failed resource lists
- Progress streaming to user interface during execution

#### 4. Rate Limit Management
- Configurable concurrency limits per AI provider
- Exponential backoff for rate limit handling
- Provider-specific optimization (OpenAI vs Anthropic)

### Data Flow
```
1. Resource List → Parallel Processing Pool
2. Each Resource → AI Inference (parallel)
3. Progress Updates → Thread-Safe Session Updates
4. Results → Batch Vector DB Storage
5. Completion → Final Progress Report
```
