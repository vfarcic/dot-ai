# PRD: Improve OpenSSF Scorecard Score

**Status**: Open
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Priority**: Medium
**GitHub Issue**: [#184](https://github.com/vfarcic/dot-ai/issues/184)

---

## Problem Statement

The DevOps AI Toolkit currently has an **OpenSSF Scorecard score of 6.1/10**, placing it in the yellow zone (moderate security concerns). This score indicates that while some security practices are in place, there are gaps in the project's security posture that should be addressed to meet industry standards and best practices.

A low OpenSSF score can:
- **Reduce trust** from potential users and contributors
- **Increase security risks** through unaddressed vulnerabilities
- **Limit adoption** by organizations with security requirements
- **Miss security best practices** that protect the project and its users
- **Create compliance issues** for users in regulated industries

## Solution Overview

Systematically analyze the OpenSSF Scorecard detailed results and implement recommended security improvements to achieve a score of **7.5+ (green zone)**. This involves:

1. **Analyzing current score** - Identify which specific checks are failing or scoring low
2. **Prioritizing improvements** - Focus on high-impact, feasible security enhancements
3. **Implementing fixes** - Make configuration, code, and process changes
4. **Validating improvements** - Verify the score increases after changes
5. **Maintaining standards** - Establish processes to maintain the improved score

## User Stories

### Story 1: Security-Conscious Organization
**As a** security engineer evaluating tools for our organization
**I want** to see a high OpenSSF Scorecard score
**So that** I can trust the tool follows security best practices

### Story 2: Open Source Contributor
**As an** open source contributor
**I want** the project to have strong security practices
**So that** I can confidently contribute without security concerns

### Story 3: Project Maintainer
**As a** project maintainer
**I want** automated security checks and protections
**So that** security issues are caught early and prevented

## Success Criteria

✅ OpenSSF Scorecard score improved from 6.1 to 7.5+ (green zone)
✅ All critical and high-priority security checks passing
✅ Security improvements documented
✅ Processes established to maintain the improved score
✅ README badge reflects the improved score

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Score Analysis**
   - Access detailed OpenSSF Scorecard results
   - Identify all failing or low-scoring checks
   - Understand remediation requirements for each check
   - Prioritize based on impact and effort

2. **Common OpenSSF Check Categories** (to be validated during analysis)
   - **Branch Protection**: Require reviews, prevent force pushes, require status checks
   - **Code Review**: Ensure all changes reviewed before merge
   - **Signed Commits**: Require DCO or GPG signatures
   - **Dependency Management**: Pin dependencies, use lock files, scan for vulnerabilities
   - **Security Policy**: SECURITY.md file presence and content
   - **Vulnerability Disclosure**: Clear process for reporting security issues
   - **Dangerous Workflow**: Avoid risky GitHub Actions patterns
   - **Token Permissions**: Minimize GitHub Actions token scopes
   - **Fuzzing**: Consider fuzzing for critical code paths
   - **SAST Tools**: Static analysis for security issues
   - **Maintained**: Recent commits and issue responses

3. **Implementation Requirements**
   - Changes must not break existing workflows
   - Security improvements should be documented
   - New requirements communicated to contributors
   - Automation preferred over manual processes

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Maintainability**: Security practices should be sustainable long-term
- **Developer Experience**: Security shouldn't significantly slow down development
- **Automation**: Automated checks preferred over manual reviews
- **Documentation**: Clear guidance for contributors on security requirements

## Implementation Plan

### Milestone 1: Analysis and Planning
- [ ] Access detailed OpenSSF Scorecard results for the project
- [ ] Document all checks with scores below 7.5
- [ ] Categorize issues by type (branch protection, dependencies, workflows, etc.)
- [ ] Assess feasibility and impact of each potential fix
- [ ] Create prioritized implementation plan

**Validation**: Comprehensive list of issues with clear remediation steps

### Milestone 2: Quick Wins - Configuration Improvements
- [ ] Implement branch protection rules (if missing or weak)
- [ ] Add or improve SECURITY.md policy
- [ ] Configure GitHub Actions token permissions
- [ ] Fix any dangerous workflow patterns
- [ ] Update documentation with security practices

**Validation**: Configuration-based checks showing green status

### Milestone 3: Dependency and Vulnerability Management
- [ ] Ensure all dependencies pinned with lock files
- [ ] Configure automated dependency scanning (Dependabot, Renovate)
- [ ] Set up vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
- [ ] Address any identified vulnerabilities
- [ ] Document dependency update process

**Validation**: Dependency-related checks passing, no known vulnerabilities

### Milestone 4: Code and Workflow Security
- [ ] Implement required code review policies
- [ ] Add SAST tools to CI/CD pipeline (if not present)
- [ ] Review and secure GitHub Actions workflows
- [ ] Consider DCO or commit signing requirements
- [ ] Validate all security workflow checks passing

**Validation**: Code review and workflow checks showing improved scores

### Milestone 5: Documentation and Process
- [ ] Update CONTRIBUTING.md with security requirements
- [ ] Document security best practices for contributors
- [ ] Create runbook for maintaining security posture
- [ ] Update README with improved security badge
- [ ] Establish periodic security review schedule

**Validation**: Clear documentation and processes in place

### Milestone 6: Validation and Monitoring
- [ ] Verify OpenSSF score reached 7.5+ target
- [ ] Test all new security measures working correctly
- [ ] Ensure no regression in development velocity
- [ ] Set up monitoring to track score over time
- [ ] Address any remaining low-priority issues

**Validation**: Score ≥ 7.5, all processes working smoothly

## Dependencies

- GitHub repository settings access (for branch protection, etc.)
- GitHub Actions configuration (for workflow changes)
- Package manager configurations (for dependency pinning)
- No external service dependencies expected

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Security requirements slow down development | Medium | Medium | Balance security with usability; automate checks |
| Breaking changes to contributor workflow | High | Low | Clear communication, documentation, migration guide |
| Some checks require significant effort | Medium | High | Prioritize high-impact items; defer low-value checks |
| Score improvement requires ongoing maintenance | Low | High | Document processes; automate monitoring |

## Testing Strategy

1. **Pre-Implementation Testing**: Validate current score and check details
2. **Incremental Validation**: Check score after each milestone
3. **Regression Testing**: Ensure existing functionality still works
4. **Contributor Testing**: Test contributor experience with new requirements
5. **Final Validation**: Verify target score achieved and maintained

## Documentation Impact

### Files to Update

1. **CONTRIBUTING.md**
   - Add security requirements for contributors
   - Document commit signing or DCO requirements (if added)
   - Explain code review requirements

2. **README.md**
   - Update OpenSSF Scorecard badge (will reflect new score)
   - Mention security posture in project description (optional)

3. **SECURITY.md**
   - May need updates based on OpenSSF recommendations
   - Ensure vulnerability disclosure process is clear

4. **.github/ configurations**
   - Branch protection rules
   - GitHub Actions workflows
   - Dependabot or Renovate configuration

### New Documentation

May need to create:
- Security best practices guide for contributors
- Runbook for maintaining security posture
- Security review checklist

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

- Achieving perfect 10/10 score (may require fuzzing, advanced SAST, etc.)
- Security certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001)
- Penetration testing
- Security audit by external firm
- Bug bounty program

## Work Log

### 2025-01-27
- Created PRD structure
- Defined problem statement based on current 6.1 score
- Identified solution approach and major milestone categories
- Established 7.5+ target score
- Noted that detailed analysis will happen during Milestone 1
