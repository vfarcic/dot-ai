## Executive Summary
Implement intelligent caching to significantly improve response times and reduce computational overhead for production deployments and frequent usage.

## Documentation Changes

### Files Created/Updated
- **`docs/performance-optimization-guide.md`** - New File - Complete guide for caching and performance features
- **`docs/mcp-guide.md`** - MCP Documentation - Add cache management MCP tools
- **`README.md`** - Project Overview - Add performance optimization to capabilities
- **`src/core/cache/`** - Technical Implementation - Multi-layer caching system modules

### Content Location Map
- **Feature Overview**: See `docs/performance-optimization-guide.md` (Section: "What is Performance Optimization")
- **Caching Architecture**: See `docs/performance-optimization-guide.md` (Section: "Multi-Layer Caching")
- **Setup Instructions**: See `docs/performance-optimization-guide.md` (Section: "Configuration")
- **MCP Tools**: See `docs/mcp-guide.md` (Section: "Cache Management Tools")
- **Examples**: See `docs/performance-optimization-guide.md` (Section: "Usage Examples")

### User Journey Validation
- [ ] **Primary workflow** documented end-to-end: Configure cache → Use dot-ai → Experience improved performance
- [ ] **Secondary workflows** have complete coverage: Cache management, monitoring, troubleshooting
- [ ] **Cross-references** between performance docs and core usage docs work correctly
- [ ] **Examples and commands** are testable via automated validation

## Implementation Requirements
- [ ] **Core functionality**: Multi-layer cache architecture with intelligent cache keys - Documented in `docs/performance-optimization-guide.md` (Section: "Cache Architecture")
- [ ] **User workflows**: Cache management and monitoring capabilities - Documented in `docs/mcp-guide.md` (Section: "Cache Management Tools")
- [ ] **Performance optimization**: >70% improvement in response times for cached operations

### Success Criteria
- [ ] **Discovery performance**: Cache hit reduces discovery from seconds to <50ms
- [ ] **Cache effectiveness**: >90% cache hit rate for repeated operations
- [ ] **Response improvement**: >70% improvement in CLI response times for cached operations
- [ ] **Cache management**: Configurable durations with intuitive settings work reliably

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Core Caching Architecture [Status: ⏳ PENDING]
**Target**: Multi-layer caching with basic performance improvements

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Design CacheManager class with multi-store architecture (schemas/, discovery/, validation/, patterns/)
- [ ] Implement intelligent cache key strategies with cluster isolation
- [ ] Add configurable TTL system with plain English duration parsing
- [ ] Create file-based persistence with atomic write operations

### Phase 2: Cache Management and Optimization [Status: ⏳ PENDING]
**Target**: Advanced cache features with monitoring and management

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Build cache management and monitoring capabilities
- [ ] Integrate with discovery engine, schema parser, memory system
- [ ] Add CLI cache management commands
- [ ] Implement MCP cache status interface

### Phase 3: Advanced Performance Features [Status: ⏳ PENDING]
**Target**: Production-grade performance optimization

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and analytics
- [ ] Implement cache warming and background refresh strategies
- [ ] Create advanced cache optimization algorithms
- [ ] Build cache cluster coordination for distributed scenarios

## Work Log

### 2025-07-28: PRD Refactoring to Documentation-First Format
**Completed Work**: Refactored PRD #8 to follow new documentation-first guidelines with comprehensive caching and performance optimization features.
