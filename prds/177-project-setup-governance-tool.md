# PRD #177: Project Setup & Governance Tool (MCP)

**GitHub Issue**: [#178](https://github.com/vfarcic/dot-ai/issues/178)
**Status**: Planning
**Priority**: High
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-23

## Problem Statement

Every software project needs proper governance documentation, development infrastructure, and best practices configuration, but creating these artifacts from scratch is time-consuming, error-prone, and requires deep knowledge of current best practices across multiple domains.

### Current State
- **New Projects**: Developers start with minimal structure (README, LICENSE), missing critical governance and community files
- **Existing Projects**: Many lack proper governance documentation, blocking CNCF submissions and enterprise adoption
- **Best Practices Gap**: Keeping up with evolving best practices across governance, security, CI/CD, containers, and cloud native is challenging
- **Manual Process**: Creating 90+ configuration files manually is tedious and inconsistent across projects
- **No Validation**: No automated way to audit project completeness against industry standards

### Problems to Solve
1. **Setup Overhead**: 40+ hours to research and create comprehensive project infrastructure from scratch
2. **Inconsistency**: Each project reinvents the wheel with varying quality and completeness
3. **Knowledge Barrier**: New maintainers don't know what files are needed or current best practices
4. **Audit Gap**: No automated way to assess existing project health and identify missing artifacts
5. **CNCF Readiness**: Projects struggle to meet CNCF Sandbox requirements (governance, security, community files)
6. **Maintenance Burden**: Keeping templates and configurations up-to-date with evolving best practices

---

## Proposed Solution

Create an MCP tool called `projectSetup` that intelligently audits existing repositories or bootstraps new projects with comprehensive governance, infrastructure, and best practices artifacts. The tool uses AI to understand context, ask relevant questions, and generate high-quality files based on authoritative sources and current best practices.

### Key Capabilities

**Dual Operation Modes:**
- **Audit Mode**: Scan existing repository, identify gaps, generate missing artifacts
- **New Mode**: Bootstrap complete repository structure from scratch

**Intelligent Analysis:**
- Auto-detect project type (language, framework, deployment target)
- Scan for existing files and configurations
- Gap analysis against best practices and compliance requirements
- Context-aware question generation

**Best Practices Integration:**
- Research and apply current best practices for each artifact
- Use authoritative templates (CNCF, OpenSSF, Contributor Covenant)
- Include explanatory comments referencing source documentation
- Version-tracked templates that evolve with industry standards

**90+ Artifact Coverage:**
- Legal & licensing (LICENSE, NOTICE, COPYRIGHT)
- Governance (CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY, MAINTAINERS, GOVERNANCE, ROADMAP)
- Community (SUPPORT, ADOPTERS, CHANGELOG)
- Documentation (ARCHITECTURE, DEVELOPMENT, RELEASE, TROUBLESHOOTING)
- GitHub infrastructure (issue templates, workflows, automation)
- Container configuration (Dockerfile, docker-compose)
- Code quality (linting, formatting, testing configs)
- Language-specific configs (Node.js, Python, Go, Rust)
- Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts
- GitOps (Argo CD, Flux)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Crossplane)
- Security & compliance (scanning configs, SBOM)

---

## Success Criteria

## User Impact

### New Project Creators
**Before**: Spend 40+ hours researching and creating governance docs, CI/CD configs, and best practices files
**After**: Answer 10-15 questions, get complete project structure in minutes with current best practices

### Existing Project Maintainers (CNCF Submission)
**Before**: Manual audit against CNCF requirements, create 20+ governance files from scratch, uncertainty about completeness
**After**: Run audit mode, answer questions, get CNCF-ready governance in <30 minutes with validation report

### Platform Engineering Teams
**Before**: Manually maintain template repositories, keep best practices updated across dozens of projects, inconsistent structure
**After**: Single tool ensures consistency, automatically applies latest best practices, validates compliance across all projects

### Open Source Contributors
**Before**: Uncertain what files to create, outdated examples from blog posts, missing critical security/governance
**After**: Confidence that project follows current best practices, clear guidance on what's needed and why

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: Template Maintenance Overhead
**Impact**: High - Outdated templates reduce tool value
**Likelihood**: High - Best practices evolve constantly
**Mitigation**:
- Establish quarterly review cycle for templates
- Monitor authoritative sources (CNCF, OpenSSF) for updates
- Community contributions for template improvements
- Automated checks for outdated dependencies in CI/CD templates
- Version templates to track evolution

### Risk: Template Customization vs Standardization Tension
**Impact**: Medium - Users may want heavy customization, reducing standardization benefits
**Likelihood**: Medium - Different projects have different needs
**Mitigation**:
- Provide sensible defaults that work for 80% of cases
- Allow template overrides for advanced users
- Support multiple template "flavors" (minimal, standard, comprehensive)
- Clear documentation on when to customize vs accept defaults

### Risk: Language/Framework Coverage Expansion
**Impact**: Medium - Pressure to support many languages increases complexity
**Likelihood**: High - Users will request additional language support
**Mitigation**:
- Start with top 4 languages (TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust)
- Modular template system allows easy addition
- Community-contributed templates for niche languages
- Focus on quality over breadth initially

### Risk: Auto-Detection Accuracy
**Impact**: Medium - Incorrect project type detection leads to wrong artifacts
**Likelihood**: Medium - Edge cases and monorepos are complex
**Mitigation**:
- Multi-signal detection (package files, directory structure, git history)
- Always allow user override of detected type
- Clear confidence scoring shown to user
- Fallback to interactive questions when detection uncertain

### Risk: Generated File Conflicts in Existing Repos
**Impact**: High - Overwriting existing files could lose user customizations
**Likelihood**: Medium - Many repos already have some governance files
**Mitigation**:
- Never overwrite without explicit confirmation
- Diff preview before applying changes
- Create backup branches automatically
- Support "merge mode" that preserves user customizations
- Default to adding missing files only

### Risk: Template Quality Variability
**Impact**: High - Poor quality templates reflect badly on tool
**Likelihood**: Low - Can control with review process
**Mitigation**:
- Rigorous template review process
- Templates based on authoritative sources with citations
- Integration tests validate template quality
- Community feedback loop for template improvements
- Regular audits of generated file quality

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Manual Template Repository (cookiecutter-style)
**Pros**: Simple to implement, users understand git-based templates, easy to customize
**Cons**: No AI intelligence, no audit mode, static templates, no validation, manual process
**Decision**: Rejected - Doesn't leverage AI capabilities or provide audit functionality

### Alternative 2: GitHub Template Repositories
**Pros**: Native GitHub integration, one-click repository creation, easy to use
**Cons**: Static templates only, no customization, no audit mode, can't add to existing repos
**Decision**: Rejected - Too limited, doesn't solve existing repository problem

### Alternative 3: Yeoman-style Generator CLI
**Pros**: Established pattern, interactive CLI, template ecosystem
**Cons**: No AI intelligence, requires npm installation, no cloud native focus, no validation
**Decision**: Rejected - Doesn't differentiate from existing tools or leverage AI

### Alternative 4: Extend Existing MCP Tool (recommend)
**Pros**: Reuses existing infrastructure, single tool interface
**Cons**: Different domain (deployment vs project setup), conflates concerns, harder to maintain
**Decision**: Rejected - Better as separate focused tool, different workflow and use cases

### Alternative 5: External Service/SaaS
**Pros**: Can maintain templates centrally, easy updates, analytics on usage
**Cons**: Requires external dependency, privacy concerns, not self-hosted, latency
**Decision**: Rejected - Conflicts with self-hosted DevOps AI Toolkit philosophy

## Open Questions

1. **Template Licensing**: What license should templates carry? (MIT to match project?)

2. **Customization Depth**: How much customization should tool support vs enforcing standards?

3. **Validation Strictness**: Should validation be blocking (prevent file generation) or warning-only?

4. **Git Integration**: Should tool automatically commit changes or leave to user?

5. **GitHub API**: Should tool create repositories via GitHub API or assume git init locally?

6. **Multi-repo Support**: Should tool support auditing multiple repositories in one organization?

7. **Template Distribution**: Should templates be embedded in tool or fetched from external source?

8. **Community Templates**: How to accept and validate community-contributed templates?

9. **Private Repository Support**: Any special handling for private vs public repositories?

10. **Language Priority**: Which language configs to implement first beyond TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust?
