# MCP Prompts Guide: Shared Prompt Library

## What are MCP Prompts

MCP Prompts provide a centralized way to share and discover prompts across projects and team members. Instead of manually copying prompt files between projects, prompts are served directly through the dot-ai MCP server and automatically appear as native slash commands in MCP-enabled coding agents.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Zero setup**: Connect to MCP server and prompts are immediately available
- **Native integration**: Prompts appear as slash commands in your coding agent's command menu
- **Cross-project sharing**: Same prompts available across all projects without file management
- **Instant updates**: New prompts added to server are immediately available to all users
- **Team consistency**: Everyone uses the same proven prompts

## Prerequisites

Before using MCP Prompts, you need:
- **MCP-enabled coding agent** (Claude Code, Cursor, or VS Code with MCP extension)  
- **Successfully configured dot-ai MCP server connection**

**Setup Required**: Follow the [MCP Setup Guide](./mcp-setup.md) to configure your environment before proceeding.

**Note**: The Anthropic API key is only required for AI-powered tools (like deployment recommendations), not for using the shared prompts library.

## How It Works

The dot-ai MCP server implements the standard MCP Prompts specification, exposing two key endpoints:

- **`prompts/list`**: Returns all available prompts with metadata
- **`prompts/get`**: Returns specific prompt content by ID

When you connect to the MCP server, your coding agent automatically discovers available prompts and makes them accessible through agent-specific interfaces. The access method varies by agent - some use slash commands, others integrate prompts as available tools.

## Using Shared Prompts

### Discovering Available Prompts

1. Ensure you're connected to the dot-ai MCP server (see [MCP Setup Guide](./mcp-setup.md))
2. Access prompts using your agent's interface:
   - **Claude Code**: Type `/` and look for `/dot-ai:prompt-name` commands
   - **VS Code + GitHub Copilot**: Use `/mcp.dot-ai.prompt-name` format
   - **Cursor**: Ask the agent to use specific prompts by name from available tools
3. Browse available prompts through your agent's discovery interface

### Executing Shared Prompts

Using shared prompts varies by coding agent:

**Claude Code:**
```bash
# Create a new PRD
/dot-ai:prd-create

# Get current PRD status
/dot-ai:prds-get
```

**VS Code + GitHub Copilot:**
```bash
# Create a new PRD
/mcp.dot-ai.prd-create

# Get current PRD status
/mcp.dot-ai.prds-get
```

**Cursor:**
```
# Ask the agent to use the tool by name
Use the prd-create prompt to create a new PRD
Run the prds-get prompt to show current PRD status
```

The prompt content executes exactly as if it were a local command file, but without any file management on your part.

## Managing Prompts

### Adding New Prompts

> **Note**: This section documents the planned prompt management interface

To add a new prompt to the shared library:

1. **Create prompt content**: Write the prompt following established patterns
2. **Define metadata**: Set name, description, and category
3. **Add to library**: Use the prompt management interface
4. **Test across clients**: Verify prompt works in different coding agents
5. **Update documentation**: Add prompt to the "Available Prompts" section above

### Prompt Organization

Prompts are organized by category:
- **`project-management`**: PRD lifecycle and project tracking prompts
- **`development`**: Code development and quality assurance prompts
- **`session-management`**: Work session continuity and context management

### Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive, kebab-case names: `prd-create`, `context-save`
- Include category prefix when helpful: `prd-next`, `context-save`
- Keep names concise but clear
- Avoid special characters or spaces

## Contributing Prompts

Have a useful prompt to share? Contribute it to the shared library:

1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
2. **Add your prompt** to the `shared-prompts/` directory following existing naming conventions
3. **Update the documentation** by adding your prompt to the "Available Prompts" section above
4. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of what the prompt does and when to use it

### Prompt Metadata Format

Each prompt file must include YAML frontmatter that defines how it appears in coding agents:

```yaml
---
name: your-prompt-name
description: Brief description of what this prompt does
category: project-management
---

# Your Prompt Content

Your prompt instructions go here...
```

**Metadata Fields:**
- **`name`**: Becomes the slash command name (e.g., `name: prd-create` â†’ `/dot-ai:prd-create`)
- **`description`**: Shows up in coding agent command menus and help text
- **`category`**: Used for organizing prompts in documentation (must be one of: `project-management`, `development`, `session-management`)

**How It Works:**
1. **MCP Server Processing**: The dot-ai MCP server reads these metadata fields from all prompt files
2. **Standard MCP Endpoints**: Metadata is exposed via `prompts/list` and `prompts/get` MCP endpoints
3. **Agent Integration**: Your coding agent discovers prompts through these endpoints and makes them available as slash commands
4. **User Experience**: The `name` becomes the command, `description` appears in menus, and `category` organizes documentation

**Contribution Guidelines:**
- Use descriptive, kebab-case names (e.g., `database-optimization`, `api-security-review`)
- Include clear purpose and usage examples in your PR description
- Test your prompt across different scenarios before contributing
- Follow the established prompt format and documentation patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Prompts don't appear in command menu**
- **Cause**: MCP server not connected or prompts capability not enabled
- **Solution**: Check MCP connection status and server configuration
- **See**: [MCP Setup Guide](./mcp-setup.md) for connection troubleshooting

**Prompt execution fails with "not found" error**
- **Cause**: Prompt ID mismatch or server synchronization issue
- **Solution**: Refresh MCP connection or restart your coding agent
- **Workaround**: Disconnect and reconnect to MCP server

**Prompts work in one agent but not another**
- **Cause**: Agent-specific MCP implementation differences
- **Solution**: Check agent-specific compatibility notes above
- **Alternative**: Use a fully compatible agent for prompt-heavy workflows
