# Pattern Management Guide

**Complete guide for creating and managing organizational deployment patterns with the DevOps AI Toolkit.**

## Overview

Pattern Management enables platform engineers and architects to capture organizational deployment knowledge as reusable patterns. These patterns automatically enhance AI deployment recommendations, ensuring consistency with your team's best practices and organizational standards.

### What is Pattern Management?

Pattern Management allows you to:
- **Create deployment patterns** that capture your organization's preferred resource combinations
- **Store patterns semantically** using Vector DB technology for intelligent matching
- **Enhance AI recommendations** with organizational context and best practices
- **Share institutional knowledge** across teams through standardized deployment approaches

### Capabilities vs Patterns

**Important**: Pattern Management is distinct from Capability Management:

- **[Capability Management](mcp-capability-management-guide.md)**: Discovers what each Kubernetes resource actually does (semantic understanding)
  - **Required for recommendations**: Enables intelligent resource discovery and semantic matching
  - **Example**: Teaches AI that `sqls.devopstoolkit.live` provides PostgreSQL database capabilities
  - **Goal**: Make AI smarter about your cluster's existing resources

- **Pattern Management**: Defines your organization's preferred resource combinations (institutional knowledge)
  - **Optional enhancement**: Adds organizational best practices to AI recommendations  
  - **Example**: Defines that web applications should include Deployment + Service + Ingress + HPA
  - **Goal**: Make AI follow your team's deployment standards

**Workflow Order**: Run capability scanning first (required), then create organizational patterns (optional but recommended).

### How It Works

1. **Pattern Creation** → Platform engineers define deployment patterns with triggers and resource recommendations
2. **Semantic Storage** → Patterns are stored with AI-generated embeddings for intelligent matching
3. **AI Integration** → When users request deployments, relevant patterns automatically enhance recommendations
4. **Continuous Learning** → Patterns improve recommendation quality over time through usage (planned for future versions)

## Prerequisites

<!-- dotai-test-hint: Start Qdrant container before testing later sections: docker run -d --name qdrant-testing -p 6333:6333 -v $(pwd)/tmp/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage qdrant/qdrant -->

Before using Pattern Management, ensure you have:

### Required Setup
- **DevOps AI Toolkit MCP server** configured (see [MCP Setup Guide](./mcp-setup.md))
- **Vector DB service** (Qdrant) for pattern storage
- **API keys** (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, QDRANT_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY) can be set as environment variables or in `.mcp.json`

For complete setup instructions, see the [MCP Setup Guide](./mcp-setup.md).

## Configuration

### Vector Database Setup

Pattern Management requires a Vector DB service for semantic pattern storage and retrieval.

#### Qdrant Cloud (Recommended)

1. **Sign up** at [Qdrant Cloud](https://cloud.qdrant.io/)
2. **Create a cluster** (free tier works fine for pattern storage)
3. **Get connection details**:
   - URL from cluster dashboard
   - API key from cluster settings
4. **Add to `.mcp.json`** environment variables

#### Local Qdrant

```bash
# Run local Qdrant with Docker (detached/background)
docker container run --detach --name qdrant --publish 6333:6333 --volume $(pwd)/tmp/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage qdrant/qdrant
```

**Configuration**:
```json
"env": {
  "QDRANT_URL": "http://localhost:6333"
}
```

**Test Connectivity**:
```bash
# Verify Qdrant is responding
curl http://localhost:6333/healthz
```

### Embedding Service Setup

For semantic pattern matching, configure an embedding service:

#### OpenAI Embeddings (Recommended)

1. **Get API key** from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) <!-- dotai-ignore: requires authentication -->
2. **Add to environment**: `"OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-proj-..."`
3. **Automatic model**: Uses `text-embedding-3-small` (1536 dimensions)

#### Alternative: Keyword-Only Matching

If no embedding service is configured, the system automatically falls back to keyword-based pattern matching, which still provides good results for exact term matches.

## Pattern Management Operations

All pattern management is done through natural conversation with your AI assistant. The system provides a guided workflow for creating comprehensive patterns.

### Creating Organizational Patterns

**Start Pattern Creation**:
```
I want to create a new organizational deployment pattern
```

The AI assistant will guide you through a step-by-step workflow:

#### Step 1: Pattern Description
The assistant will ask for a clear description of your pattern:

**Example**:
```
Assistant: What deployment capability does this pattern provide? I need a capability name (2-4 words).

You: stateless web applications
```

#### Step 2: Trigger Keywords
Define initial keywords that should activate this pattern:

**Example**:
```
Assistant: What keywords or phrases should trigger this pattern? Please provide keywords separated by commas.

You: stateless application, web app, api service, microservice, rest api, frontend application
```

#### Step 3: Trigger Expansion
The system suggests additional related terms:

**Example**:
```
Assistant: I found these additional terms that might also trigger your pattern:
- application
- service
- workload

Which should also trigger this pattern? You can select specific ones, include all, or skip.

You: include: application, service, workload
```

#### Step 4: Suggested Resources
Specify Kubernetes resources this pattern should recommend:

**Example**:
```
Assistant: Which Kubernetes resources should be suggested for stateless web applications? Please list the resource types separated by commas.

You: Deployment, Service, Ingress, HorizontalPodAutoscaler
```

#### Step 5: Rationale
Explain why these resources work well together:

**Example**:
```
Assistant: Why does this combination of resources work well together for stateless web applications?

You: This combination provides a complete stateless application deployment: Deployment manages replicated pods without persistent state, Service provides stable network access, Ingress handles external routing and SSL termination, and HorizontalPodAutoscaler automatically scales based on demand. Together they create resilient, scalable applications that can handle traffic fluctuations and failures gracefully.
```

#### Step 6: Pattern Ownership
Specify who created the pattern:

**Example**:
```
Assistant: What is your name or team identifier? This helps track pattern ownership.

You: platform-team
```

#### Step 7: Review and Confirmation
Review the complete pattern before creation:

**Example**:
```
Assistant: Please review your pattern:

**Description**: stateless web applications
**Triggers**: stateless application, web app, api service, microservice, rest api, frontend application, application, service, workload
**Suggested Resources**: Deployment, Service, Ingress, HorizontalPodAutoscaler
**Rationale**: This combination provides a complete stateless application deployment...
**Created By**: platform-team

Does this look correct? Type 'confirm' to create the pattern, or 'modify' to make changes.

You: confirm
```

The system will then create and store your pattern with semantic embeddings for intelligent matching.

**Note**: The conversation examples above are simplified for readability. The actual workflow uses structured prompts, specific response formats, and includes additional validation steps, but the core information flow remains the same.

### Listing Patterns

```

### Viewing Pattern Details

**Get Specific Pattern**:
```
Show me details for the stateless applications pattern
```

**Example Response**:
```
Pattern: Stateless Applications

**Description**: Stateless web applications
**Created**: 2025-01-15 by platform-team

**Triggers** (8):
- stateless application
- web app
- api service  
- microservice
- rest api
- frontend application
- http service
- web service

**Suggested Resources** (4):
- Deployment
- Service
- Ingress
- HorizontalPodAutoscaler

**Rationale**: 
This combination provides a complete stateless application deployment: Deployment manages replicated pods without persistent state, Service provides stable network access, Ingress handles external routing and SSL termination, and HorizontalPodAutoscaler automatically scales based on demand. Together they create resilient, scalable applications that can handle traffic fluctuations and failures gracefully.
```

### Deleting Patterns

**Remove Pattern**:
```
Delete the network security pattern
```

The assistant will confirm the deletion and remove the pattern from storage.

## AI Integration

Patterns automatically enhance deployment recommendations when users request deployments. For complete examples of how patterns influence recommendations, see the [MCP Recommendation Guide](mcp-recommendation-guide.md).

The recommendation system automatically:
- Searches for relevant patterns using semantic matching
- Includes pattern context in AI prompts  
- Balances organizational consistency with specific user needs

**Important**: Patterns serve as suggestions to enhance AI decision-making, not rigid requirements.

## Pattern Examples

### Example 1: Stateless Application Pattern

**Use Case**: Standard web applications, APIs, and microservices

```yaml
Description: Stateless web applications
Triggers:
  - stateless application
  - web app
  - api service
  - microservice
  - rest api
  - frontend application
Resources:
  - Deployment
  - Service  
  - Ingress
  - HorizontalPodAutoscaler
Rationale: Provides complete stateless deployment with scaling, networking, and external access
```

**When It Activates**: User requests for "web app", "API deployment", "microservice setup", etc.

### Example 2: Database Workload Pattern

**Use Case**: Persistent databases and stateful services

```yaml
Description: Database and persistent storage workloads
Triggers:
  - database
  - persistent storage
  - stateful service
  - data store
  - mysql
  - postgresql
Resources:
  - StatefulSet
  - PersistentVolumeClaim
  - Secret
  - Service
Rationale: Ensures data persistence, ordered deployment, and secure credential management
```

**When It Activates**: User requests for "database deployment", "persistent storage", "MySQL setup", etc.

### Example 3: Network Security Pattern

**Use Case**: Security-focused deployments with network isolation

```yaml
Description: Network security and isolation policies
Triggers:
  - network security
  - network isolation
  - security policy
  - network policy
  - microsegmentation
Resources:
  - NetworkPolicy
  - ServiceAccount
  - Role
  - RoleBinding
Rationale: Implements defense-in-depth with network segmentation and RBAC controls
```

**Note**: This pattern uses Pod Security Standards (successor to deprecated PodSecurityPolicy) for pod-level security controls, which are configured at the namespace level rather than as individual resources.

**When It Activates**: User mentions "security", "network isolation", "compliance requirements", etc.

### Example 4: Monitoring Pattern

**Use Case**: Applications requiring observability and monitoring

```yaml
Description: Monitoring and observability setup
Triggers:
  - monitoring
  - observability
  - metrics
  - logging
  - tracing
  - prometheus
Resources:
  - ServiceMonitor
  - PodMonitor
  - PrometheusRule
  - ConfigMap
Rationale: Provides comprehensive observability with metrics collection, alerting, and dashboard configuration
```

**Note**: Resources like ServiceMonitor, PodMonitor, and PrometheusRule are Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) provided by the Prometheus Operator and require it to be installed in your cluster. ConfigMap stores dashboard configurations for Grafana.

**When It Activates**: User requests including "monitoring", "observability", "metrics collection", etc.

## Best Practices

### Pattern Creation Guidelines

#### 1. Focus and Composability
- **Create focused patterns** for specific use cases rather than trying to cover everything
- **Make patterns composable** so multiple patterns can enhance a single recommendation
- **Avoid overlapping triggers** that might cause confusion between patterns

**Good Example**:
```yaml
# Focused pattern
Description: "Load balancer setup"
Triggers: ["load balancer", "external access", "ingress"]
Resources: ["Service", "Ingress"]
```

**Avoid**:
```yaml  
# Too broad
Description: "Complete application setup"  
Triggers: ["application", "app", "deploy", "service", "database", "monitoring"]
Resources: ["Deployment", "Service", "Ingress", "StatefulSet", "PVC", "Secret", "ServiceMonitor"]
```

#### 2. Clear Trigger Keywords
- **Use specific triggers** that clearly indicate when the pattern applies
- **Include common variations** and synonyms users might employ
- **Add technical terms** your team commonly uses

**Effective Triggers**:
```yaml
Triggers:
  - "stateless application"    # Specific architecture term
  - "web app"                  # Common colloquial term  
  - "api service"              # Technical specification
  - "microservice"             # Architecture pattern
  - "rest api"                 # Implementation detail
```

#### 3. Meaningful Rationales  
- **Explain the why** behind resource combinations
- **Describe interactions** between suggested resources
- **Include failure scenarios** the pattern addresses

**Strong Rationale Example**:
```
"This combination provides complete stateless deployment: Deployment manages replicated pods without persistent state, Service provides stable network access, Ingress handles external routing and SSL termination, and HorizontalPodAutoscaler automatically scales based on demand. Together they create resilient applications that can handle traffic fluctuations and pod failures gracefully."
```

### Organizational Adoption

#### 1. Start Simple
- **Begin with 3-5 core patterns** covering your most common deployment types
- **Validate with actual deployments** before expanding the pattern library
- **Gather feedback** from development teams on pattern usefulness

#### 2. Team Collaboration
- **Involve multiple teams** in pattern creation (platform, security, development)
- **Document pattern ownership** for future updates and maintenance
- **Create patterns for team-specific needs** (data team patterns, frontend patterns, etc.)

#### 3. Iterative Improvement
- **Gather feedback** from teams on pattern effectiveness and usage
- **Update patterns** based on changing organizational needs
- **Archive outdated patterns** that no longer reflect best practices

### Pattern Quality Guidelines

These are manual best practices for creating effective patterns. The system performs basic validation (required fields) but does not automatically warn about quality issues.

#### 1. Resource Selection
- **Include complementary resources** that work well together
- **Focus on the core resources** needed for the pattern's use case
- **Consider resource relationships** when selecting combinations

#### 2. Trigger Optimization  
- **Test triggers** with real user language from past deployment requests
- **Include both formal and informal terms** teams actually use
- **Avoid overly generic triggers** that match unrelated requests

#### 3. Maintenance
- **Review patterns quarterly** to ensure they remain current
- **Update resources** when new Kubernetes features become available
- **Validate rationales** against current architectural decisions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Pattern Creation Fails

**Symptom**: Error when creating patterns through AI assistant

**Possible Causes**:
- Vector DB connection issues
- Missing required environment variables
- Qdrant collection initialization problems

**Solutions**:
1. **Check system status**:
   ```
   What's the status of the pattern management system?
   ```

2. **Verify Vector DB connection**:
   - Confirm `QDRANT_URL` and `QDRANT_API_KEY` in `.mcp.json`
   - Test Qdrant accessibility from your network
   - Check Qdrant cluster status in dashboard

3. **Validate environment variables**:
   ```json
   {
     "env": {
       "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "required_for_ai_features",
       "QDRANT_URL": "required_for_pattern_storage", 
       "QDRANT_API_KEY": "required_for_qdrant_access"
     }
   }
   ```

#### Patterns Not Found During Search

**Symptom**: Relevant patterns don't appear in recommendations

**Possible Causes**:
- Trigger keywords don't match user language
- Embedding service not configured properly
- Pattern storage issues

**Solutions**:
1. **Review pattern triggers**:
   - Check if triggers match the language users actually employ
   - Add more trigger variations and synonyms
   - Test trigger effectiveness with common user requests

2. **Check search capabilities**:
   ```
   Show me search capabilities for patterns
   ```

3. **Verify embedding service**:
   - Confirm `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set for semantic search
   - Test that embedding service is responding
   - Check if patterns have embeddings stored

#### Semantic Search Not Working

**Symptom**: Only exact keyword matches work, semantic similarities missed

**Possible Causes**:
- OpenAI API key missing or invalid
- Patterns created without embeddings
- Embedding service connectivity issues

**Solutions**:
1. **Verify OpenAI configuration**:
   - Confirm valid `OPENAI_API_KEY` in environment
   - Test OpenAI API accessibility
   - Check API key permissions and usage limits

2. **Check embedding status**:
   ```
   What's the status of the embedding service?
   ```

3. **Recreate patterns if needed**:
   - Patterns created without embedding service may need recreation
   - New patterns will automatically include embeddings if service is available
