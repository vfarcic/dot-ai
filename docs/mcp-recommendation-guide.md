# DevOps AI Toolkit MCP Recommendation Guide

**Complete guide for using Kubernetes deployment recommendations through MCP (Model Context Protocol).**

## Prerequisites

Before using this guide, complete the [MCP Setup](mcp-setup.md) to configure your MCP server with:
- DevOps AI Toolkit MCP server running
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` configured
- `KUBECONFIG` pointing to your Kubernetes cluster (optional but recommended)

**Required - Capability Management:**
- Vector DB service (Qdrant) for capability storage
- Cluster capabilities discovered via [Capability Management Guide](mcp-capability-management-guide.md)
- **Note**: Recommendations will fail without capabilities - the system requires semantic understanding of your cluster resources

**Optional - Enhanced with Organizational Patterns:**
- Organizational patterns created via [Pattern Management Guide](pattern-management-guide.md)
- When configured, recommendations automatically include organizational best practices

## Overview

**What it does**: Provides AI-powered Kubernetes deployment recommendations with semantic capability matching, organizational pattern integration, and guided workflow from intent clarification through deployment.

**Use when**: You need intelligent deployment recommendations that leverage your cluster's actual capabilities, follow organizational best practices, and guide you through configuration, manifest generation, and deployment.

üìñ **Full Guide**: This document covers the complete recommendation workflow with detailed examples and behind-the-scenes explanations.

### Key Features

The DevOps AI Toolkit recommendation feature provides:
- **Smart intent clarification** - Adaptive questioning to gather missing context for better recommendations
- **Semantic capability understanding** - Uses discovered resource capabilities for intelligent semantic matching
- **AI-powered recommendations** - Suggests optimal deployment approaches based on capability-filtered resources with rich context
- **Enhanced resource discovery** - Finds resources like `sqls.devopstoolkit.live` for "PostgreSQL database" requests through semantic search
- **Organizational pattern integration** - Automatically enhances recommendations with your team's best practices and standards
- **Guided configuration** - Step-by-step configuration collection for your deployments
- **Manifest generation** - Creates ready-to-deploy Kubernetes YAML files
- **Automated deployment** - Deploys and monitors your applications

### How Capability-Enhanced Recommendations Work

**Traditional Problem**: AI sees `sqls.devopstoolkit.live` as a meaningless name among many cluster resources.

**Capability Solution**: AI understands that `sqls.devopstoolkit.live` provides PostgreSQL database capabilities with multi-cloud support.

**Recommendation Flow**:
1. **User Intent**: "I need a PostgreSQL database"
2. **Capability Search**: Semantic search finds relevant resources with capability context
3. **Pre-filtered Results**: AI gets semantically relevant resources instead of all generic resource names
4. **Enhanced Recommendations**: Optimal matches like `sqls.devopstoolkit.live` appear as top suggestions

## Complete Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Stateless Golang Web Application

```md
User: I want to deploy a stateless Golang web application
```

```md
Agent: I'll help you deploy a stateless Golang web application. To provide the best recommendations, I have a few clarification questions:

[Uses mcp__dot-ai__recommend with intent "deploy a stateless Golang web application"]

**Application Details:**
1. What is the expected traffic pattern and scaling requirements for your application?

**Environment & Infrastructure:**
2. Is this for development, staging, or production use?

**Security & Networking:**
3. Does your application need external access or will it only serve internal traffic?

**Performance & Resources:**
4. Do you have specific CPU, memory, or storage requirements?

**Integration:**
5. Are there any other services this application needs to connect to?

**Additional Context:**
6. Are there any other specific requirements or constraints we should consider?

You can answer the questions that are relevant to your needs, or let me know if you'd like to proceed with the information provided.
```

```md
User: It's for production, needs external access, expects moderate traffic with occasional spikes, and needs to connect to a PostgreSQL database.
```

```md
Agent: Perfect! Based on your clarified requirements, let me get production-focused deployment recommendations.

[Uses mcp__dot-ai__recommend with refined intent "deploy a production stateless Golang web application with external access, auto-scaling for traffic spikes, and PostgreSQL database connectivity" and final: true]

Based on your cluster capabilities, I found 3 deployment options:

1. **Complete Stateless Application Stack (Score: 85)** - RECOMMENDED
   - Resources: Deployment, Service, HorizontalPodAutoscaler, NetworkPolicy
   - Features: Pod lifecycle management, stable networking, automatic scaling, network security
   - Uses organizational patterns: ‚úÖ Stateless Apps Pattern, Network Security Pattern
   - Best for: Production deployments requiring security and scaling
   
2. **Simple Application Deployment (Score: 72)**
   - Resources: Deployment, Service
   - Features: Basic pod management and networking
   - Uses organizational patterns: ‚ùå
   - Best for: Development/testing or simple use cases
   
3. **Minimal Pod Deployment (Score: 58)**
   - Resources: Deployment only
   - Features: Basic container orchestration
   - Uses organizational patterns: ‚ùå
   - Best for: Internal services that don't need external access

Which approach interests you most?
```

**What happened behind the scenes:**
- Capability search found relevant resources: Deployment (score: 0.85), Service (score: 0.78), HorizontalPodAutoscaler (score: 0.65)
- Vector DB search found matching organizational patterns: Stateless Apps Pattern (score: 0.621), Network Security Pattern (score: 0.333) 
- AI received pre-filtered capability-rich resources with semantic context instead of raw resource names
- Generated 3 solution alternatives with different complexity/capability tradeoffs, scoring based on capability relevance and pattern influence

**Note:** Requires capability scanning via [Capability Management Guide](mcp-capability-management-guide.md) and optionally organizational patterns via [Pattern Management](pattern-management-guide.md). Policy requirements shown require active policy intents created via [Policy Management Guide](policy-management-guide.md).

```md
User: I'll go with option 1
```

```md
Agent: Excellent choice! Let me get the configuration requirements.

[Uses mcp__dot-ai__recommend with stage: 'chooseSolution', solutionId: 'sol_2025-08-01T151532_d0e8f0c19e0e']

I need some required details to configure your deployment:

**Required Configuration:**
- What name should be used for the application resources? (e.g., "my-go-app")
- Which namespace should the application be deployed to? (options: a-team, b-team, default, kube-public)
- What is the container image for your Go application? (e.g., "registry.example.com/go-app:v1.0.0")
- What port does your Go application listen on? (1-65535)

üõ°Ô∏è **Policy Requirements:**
- **CPU resource limit** ‚ö†Ô∏è required by Resource Limits Policy (minimum: 100m, maximum: 2000m)
- **Memory resource limit** ‚ö†Ô∏è required by Resource Limits Policy (minimum: 128Mi, maximum: 4Gi)
```

**What happened behind the scenes:**
- recommend tool with stage 'chooseSolution' loaded the selected solution and returned only the required stage questions
- Questions generated from resource schema analysis: Deployment needs name/image/port, Service needs port configuration
- Policy search found relevant policy intents: "Resource Limits Policy" (score: 0.89)
- Policy requirements promoted to REQUIRED questions with compliance indicators and constraints
- System categorizes questions as required (must answer) to proceed

```md
User: App name is "my-app", deploy to "a-team" namespace, image is "ghcr.io/vfarcic/silly-demo:v1.5.151", port 8080. CPU limit 500m, memory limit 512Mi.
```

```md
Agent: Perfect! Let me configure the required settings.

[Uses mcp__dot-ai__recommend with stage: 'answerQuestion:required', solutionId, answers]

Great! Your configuration meets all policy requirements:
‚úÖ **Resource Limits Policy**: CPU (500m) and memory (512Mi) within acceptable ranges

Now for some basic configuration options:

**Basic Configuration (optional):**
- How many replicas of the application should run? (default: 3)
- What type of Service should be created? (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer)
- Enable horizontal pod autoscaling? (true/false)
```

**What happened behind the scenes:**
- recommend tool with stage 'answerQuestion:required' processed required stage answers and updated solution file
- Validated all required fields were provided (name, namespace, image, port)
- Determined next stage is 'basic' and returned basic configuration questions
- Questions are optional at this stage - user can answer or skip to advanced stage

```md
User: 3 replicas, ClusterIP service, and yes to autoscaling.
```

```md
Agent: Excellent! Let me configure those settings.

[Uses mcp__dot-ai__recommend with stage: 'answerQuestion:basic', solutionId, answers]

Would you like to configure advanced features?

**Advanced Configuration (optional):**
- Specify container resource limits (CPU and memory)? (true/false)
- Maximum CPU cores per pod? (e.g., "500m")
- Maximum memory per pod? (e.g., "512Mi")
- Minimum number of replicas for autoscaling? (default: 2)
- Maximum number of replicas for autoscaling? (default: 10)
- Target CPU utilization percentage for autoscaling? (default: 80)
```

**What happened behind the scenes:**
- recommend tool with stage 'answerQuestion:basic' processed basic stage answers (replicas: 3, serviceType: ClusterIP, autoscaling: true)
- Updated solution file and determined next stage is 'advanced'
- Returned advanced configuration questions focused on resource limits and autoscaling tuning

```md
User: Skip advanced configuration
```

```md
Agent: No problem! Moving to the final configuration stage.

[Uses mcp__dot-ai__recommend with stage: 'answerQuestion:advanced', solutionId, answers: {}]

Any additional requirements or constraints?

**Open Configuration:**
- Are there any additional requirements or constraints for your Go application deployment that we should consider? (e.g., specific security requirements, networking constraints, performance needs...)
```

**What happened behind the scenes:**
- recommend tool with stage 'answerQuestion:advanced' processed empty advanced stage answers (skipped all advanced questions)
- Marked advanced questions as explicitly skipped (answer: null)
- Determined next stage is 'open' and returned the open-ended question

```md

### Example 2: Microservice API with Auto-scaling

```md
User: I want to deploy a REST API microservice that needs to handle variable traffic loads
```

```md
Agent: I'll help you deploy a REST API microservice for variable traffic. To provide optimal scaling recommendations, I have some questions:

[Uses mcp__dot-ai__recommend with intent "deploy REST API microservice with variable traffic loads"]

**API Architecture:**
1. What type of API are you deploying (REST, GraphQL, gRPC) and what's the expected request/response pattern?

**Traffic & Scaling:**
2. What are your expected traffic patterns - steady load, burst traffic, or unpredictable spikes?

**External Access:**
3. Does this API need external internet access, or will it only serve internal microservices?

**Data & Dependencies:**
4. What external dependencies does your API have (databases, other services, third-party APIs)?

**Environment & Security:**
5. Is this for production use, and do you have specific security or compliance requirements?

**Performance Requirements:**
6. Do you have specific latency, throughput, or availability requirements?

**Additional Context:**
7. Are there any other specific requirements for this microservice deployment?

You can answer the relevant questions, or let me know if you'd like recommendations based on the current information.
```

```md
User: It's a REST API for internal services, expects unpredictable traffic spikes, needs to connect to PostgreSQL and Redis, for production with high availability requirements.
```

```md
Agent: Excellent! Based on your production requirements with traffic spikes and high availability needs, let me get deployment recommendations.

[Uses mcp__dot-ai__recommend with refined intent "deploy production REST API microservice for internal services with unpredictable traffic spikes, PostgreSQL and Redis connectivity, high availability requirements" and final: true]

Based on your requirements, I found 3 scalable deployment options:

1. **Enterprise API Stack (Score: 88)**
   - Resources: Deployment, Service, HorizontalPodAutoscaler, Ingress, ServiceMonitor
   - Features: Advanced scaling, external access, traffic routing, monitoring integration
   - Uses organizational patterns: ‚úÖ API Service Pattern, Monitoring Pattern
   - Best for: Production APIs with external access and observability
   
2. **Internal API Service (Score: 79)**
   - Resources: Deployment, Service, HorizontalPodAutoscaler
   - Features: Automatic scaling, internal networking
   - Uses organizational patterns: ‚úÖ Stateless Apps Pattern
   - Best for: Internal microservices within the cluster
   
3. **Simple API Deployment (Score: 65)**
   - Resources: Deployment, Service
   - Features: Basic API hosting with fixed scaling
   - Uses organizational patterns: ‚ùå
   - Best for: Development or low-traffic APIs

Which approach fits your API requirements?
```

**What happened behind the scenes:**
- Initial intent triggered clarification with 7 targeted questions covering API architecture, traffic patterns, dependencies, and production requirements
- User provided specific clarification: internal REST API, unpredictable traffic spikes, PostgreSQL/Redis dependencies, production HA requirements
- Enhanced intent analysis extracted key concepts: "production REST API", "internal microservices", "unpredictable traffic spikes", "PostgreSQL/Redis connectivity", "high availability"
- Pattern matching found: API Service Pattern (high relevance), Stateless Apps Pattern (medium relevance)
- The clarified "unpredictable traffic spikes" and "high availability" requirements strongly influenced resource selection toward HorizontalPodAutoscaler and monitoring
- Generated 3 solutions prioritizing internal access and scaling capabilities based on clarified production requirements

**Note:** Pattern integration requires [Pattern Management](pattern-management-guide.md) setup with Vector DB and organizational patterns. Policy requirements shown require active policy intents created via [Policy Management Guide](policy-management-guide.md).

```md
User: Option 2 please
```

```md
Agent: Great choice! Internal APIs with autoscaling are ideal for microservice architectures. Let me get the configuration details.

[Uses mcp__dot-ai__recommend with stage: 'chooseSolution', solutionId]

I need some required details to configure your API deployment:

**Required Configuration:**
- API service name? (e.g., "user-api", "order-service")
- Target namespace for deployment?
- Container image for your API? (e.g., "myregistry/api:v2.1.0")
- API port your service listens on?

üõ°Ô∏è **Policy Requirements:**
- **CPU resource limit** ‚ö†Ô∏è required by Resource Limits Policy (minimum: 100m, maximum: 2000m)
- **Memory resource limit** ‚ö†Ô∏è required by Resource Limits Policy (minimum: 128Mi, maximum: 4Gi)
```

**What happened behind the scenes:**
- recommend tool with stage 'chooseSolution' loaded the Internal API Service solution and returned only required stage questions
- Questions focused on API-specific needs: service naming, microservice namespace, container image, port
- Policy search found relevant policy intents: "Resource Limits Policy" (score: 0.91) 
- Policy requirements promoted to REQUIRED questions with compliance constraints
- System recognizes this is for "variable traffic" and will emphasize scaling in later stages

```md
User: Service name "payment-api", namespace "microservices", image "internal/payment-api:v3.2.1", port 8080. CPU limit 500m, memory limit 1Gi.
```

```md
Agent: Perfect! Let me configure the required settings.

[Uses mcp__dot-ai__recommend with stage: 'answerQuestion:required', solutionId, answers]

Great! Your configuration meets all policy requirements:
‚úÖ **Resource Limits Policy**: CPU (500m) and memory (1Gi) within acceptable ranges

Now for scaling configuration:

**Basic Configuration (optional):**
- Initial number of replicas? (default: 2)
- Enable horizontal pod autoscaling? (recommended: true)
- Target CPU utilization for scaling? (default: 70%)
- Maximum replicas during high traffic? (default: 10)
```

**What happened behind the scenes:**
- recommend tool with stage 'answerQuestion:required' processed required API configuration (service name, namespace, image, port)
- Validated all required fields and updated solution file
- Moved to basic stage focused on scaling configuration (core requirement from "variable traffic loads")
- Questions are optional but recommended for traffic handling

```md
User: 2 replicas initially, enable autoscaling at 70% CPU, max 15 replicas.
```

```md
