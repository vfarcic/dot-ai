## Overview

DevOps AI Toolkit is committed to transparent and inclusive decision-making. This document outlines how decisions are made and who has authority over different aspects of the project.

## Roles

### Contributors

### Maintainers

Maintainers have write access to the repository and are responsible for:

## Decision-Making Process

### Routine Decisions

Day-to-day technical decisions are made by maintainers through:

- Pull request reviews
- Issue discussions
- Direct commits for minor changes

### Major Decisions

Significant changes require consensus among maintainers:

- Architecture changes
- Breaking changes
- New feature additions
- Governance changes

**Consensus Process:**

1. Proposal is documented in an issue or discussion
2. Maintainers discuss and provide feedback
3. If no objections within 7 days, consensus is reached
4. If objections exist, continue discussion or call for a vote

### Voting

When consensus cannot be reached, decisions are made by vote:

- Each maintainer has one vote
- Decisions require  of maintainers to pass
- Votes are recorded in the relevant issue or pull request

5. **Approval** - Majority vote from current maintainers
