# Capability Management Guide

<!-- dotai-test-hint: Test all capability management workflows using mcp__dot-ai__manageOrgData tool with dataType="capabilities" and various operations (scan, list, get, search, delete, deleteAll, progress) to verify documented examples match actual tool behavior. For scanning, use "specific" subset with 1-2 test resources, NOT "all" as full cluster scans take too long -->

**Complete guide for discovering, managing, and leveraging Kubernetes resource capabilities with the DevOps AI Toolkit.**

## Overview

Capability Management transforms how the DevOps AI Toolkit understands your Kubernetes cluster by discovering and storing semantic information about what each resource actually does. Instead of treating resources as generic names, the system learns their capabilities, providers, complexity, and use cases - enabling intelligent, context-aware deployment recommendations.

### What is Capability Management?

Traditional Kubernetes deployment tools see resources like `sqls.devopstoolkit.live` as meaningless names among all the resources in your cluster. Capability Management teaches the system that `sqls.devopstoolkit.live` is actually a PostgreSQL database solution with low complexity, supporting multiple cloud providers.

**The Problem**: 
```
User: "I need a PostgreSQL database"
AI: Gets all cluster resources [sqls.devopstoolkit.live, Deployment, StatefulSet, Service, ...]
AI: Must analyze each resource individually to understand what it does
AI: Often makes poor matches due to overwhelming choices and lack of context
Result: Suboptimal recommendations based on incomplete understanding
```

**The Solution**:
```
User: "I need a PostgreSQL database" 
System: Semantic search finds database-relevant resources with rich context
AI: Gets pre-filtered candidates that actually match the intent
AI: Makes informed decisions using capability context (postgresql, complexity, providers)
Result: Optimal recommendations whether using 1 resource, 5 resources, or 50 resources
```

### How It Works

1. **Capability Discovery** → System analyzes your cluster resources and infers what each one does
2. **Semantic Storage** → Capabilities are stored with AI-generated embeddings for intelligent matching  
3. **Smart Recommendations** → Deployment requests get pre-filtered, relevant resources with rich context
4. **Informed AI Decisions** → AI makes better choices based on capability understanding

[![Why Kubernetes Discovery Sucks for AI (And How Vector DBs Fix It)](https://img.youtube.com/vi/MSNstHj4rmk/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/MSNstHj4rmk)

This video demonstrates the real-world challenge of discovering the right Kubernetes resources when you have hundreds of cryptically named resource types in your cluster. Watch how both humans and AI struggle with traditional keyword-based searching through 443+ resources, and see how semantic search with vector databases transforms an unsearchable cluster into an instantly discoverable one where you can describe what you want to accomplish rather than memorizing cryptic resource names.

### Understanding Organizational Data Types

Capability Management provides the foundation for other organizational intelligence features in the DevOps AI Toolkit.

**Quick Overview**:
- **Capabilities**: What resources can do (this guide - required foundation)
- **Patterns**: What resources to deploy together (organizational preferences)  
- **Policies**: How resources should be configured (governance requirements)

For a complete understanding of how these three types work together, see the **[Organizational Data Concepts Guide](organizational-data-concepts.md)**.

## Prerequisites

Before using Capability Management, ensure you have:

### Required Setup
- **DevOps AI Toolkit MCP server** configured (see [MCP Setup Guide](./mcp-setup.md))
- **Vector DB service** (Qdrant) for capability storage and semantic search
- **AI integration** for capability inference (see [AI Model Configuration](mcp-setup.md#ai-model-configuration) for supported models and API keys)
- **Kubernetes cluster access** for resource discovery and schema analysis

### Optional Enhancements  
- **Embedding provider** configured for semantic search (see [Embedding Provider Configuration](mcp-setup.md#embedding-provider-configuration) for options)
- **Organizational patterns** for enhanced recommendations (see [Pattern Management Guide](./pattern-management-guide.md))

For complete setup instructions, see the [MCP Setup Guide](./mcp-setup.md).

## Capability Management Operations

### Cluster Capability Scanning

Discover and analyze all resources in your Kubernetes cluster through a complete workflow:

#### Initial Setup
```
User: I want to scan my cluster for resource capabilities

Agent: Would you like to scan all cluster resources or specify a subset?

Options:
1. All resources - Comprehensive analysis of all cluster resources
2. Specific subset - Choose specific resource types for focused analysis
```

#### Scanning Workflow Options

**Complete Cluster Analysis (Recommended)**
```
User: All resources

Agent: How would you like to process the resources?

Options:
1. Auto mode - Batch process all resources automatically (recommended for production)  
2. Manual mode - Review each capability analysis individually (useful for testing/validation)

User: Auto mode

Agent: Starting comprehensive cluster capability scan...

[Scanning happens in background - no progress updates shown]

Agent: ✅ Capability scan completed successfully! Processed cluster resources.

Your cluster capabilities are now available for intelligent deployment recommendations.
```

**Focused Resource Scanning**
```
User: Specific subset

Agent: Please provide specific resource list (comma-separated):
Format: Kind.group for CRDs, Kind for core resources
Examples: sqls.devopstoolkit.live, deployments.apps, services

User: sqls.devopstoolkit.live, server.dbforpostgresql.azure.upbound.io, persistentvolumeclaims

Agent: How would you like to process these 3 resources?

Options:
1. Auto mode - Batch process automatically 
2. Manual mode - Review each analysis individually

### Monitor Scanning Progress

Track the progress of a running capability scan. **Important**: Since scanning runs in the foreground and blocks the current agent session, you must use a **separate agent session** to monitor real-time progress while scanning is active in another session:

```
User: Check the progress of my capability scan

Agent: [Uses manageOrgData with dataType: "capabilities", operation: "progress"]

**Capability Scan Progress**

📊 **Current Status:** Scan completed successfully
✅ **Results:** Processed cluster resources and stored capabilities  
🔍 **Available Operations:** Use list, search, or get operations to explore discovered capabilities

Your cluster capabilities are now ready for enhanced deployment recommendations.
```

### List Discovered Capabilities  

View all capabilities that have been discovered and stored:

```
User: Show me the capabilities that were discovered

Agent: [Uses manageOrgData with dataType: "capabilities", operation: "list"]

## Integration with Deployment Recommendations

<!-- dotai-ignore: This section is primarily referential - testing is done in the recommendation guide -->

Once capabilities are discovered and stored, they automatically enhance deployment recommendations by providing semantic context about each resource's purpose and complexity. This enables the AI to make smarter, more informed suggestions tailored to your specific cluster capabilities.

**For complete examples and workflows**, see the [Recommendation Guide](./mcp-recommendation-guide.md).
