DevOps AI Toolkit is an AI-powered development productivity platform that enhances software development workflows through intelligent automation and AI-driven assistance.


## Who is this for?

### Kubernetes Deployment
- **Developers**: Deploy applications without needing deep Kubernetes expertise
- **Platform Engineers**: Create organizational deployment patterns that enhance AI recommendations with institutional knowledge and best practices, and scan cluster resources to enable semantic matching for dramatically improved recommendation accuracy
- **Security Engineers**: Define governance policies that integrate into deployment workflows with optional Kyverno enforcement

### Documentation Testing  
- **Documentation Maintainers**: Automatically validate documentation accuracy and catch outdated content
- **Technical Writers**: Identify which sections need updates and prioritize work effectively
- **Open Source Maintainers**: Ensure documentation works correctly for new contributors

### Shared Prompts Library
- **Development Teams**: Share proven prompts across projects without file management
- **Project Managers**: Standardize workflows with consistent prompt usage across teams
- **Individual Developers**: Access curated prompt library via native slash commands

### AI Integration
- **AI Agents**: Integrate all capabilities with Claude Code, Cursor, or VS Code for conversational workflows

## Key Features

### Kubernetes Deployment Intelligence
🔍 **Smart Discovery**: Automatically finds all available resources and operators in your cluster  
🧠 **Semantic Capability Management**: Discovers what each resource actually does for intelligent matching  
🤖 **AI Recommendations**: Smart intent clarification gathers missing context, then provides deployment suggestions tailored to your specific cluster setup with enhanced semantic understanding  
🔧 **Operator-Aware**: Leverages custom operators and CRDs when available  
🚀 **Complete Workflow**: From discovery to deployment with automated Kubernetes integration

#### Capability-Enhanced Recommendations
Transform how AI understands your cluster by discovering semantic capabilities of each resource:

**The Problem**: Traditional discovery sees `sqls.devopstoolkit.live` as a meaningless name among hundreds of resources.

**The Solution**: Capability management teaches the system that `sqls.devopstoolkit.live` handles PostgreSQL databases with multi-cloud support.

**Before Capability Management:**
```
User: "I need a PostgreSQL database"
AI: Gets 400+ generic resource names → picks complex multi-resource solution
Result: Misses optimal single-resource solutions
```

**After Capability Management:**
```
User: "I need a PostgreSQL database"  
AI: Gets pre-filtered relevant resources with rich context
Result: Finds sqls.devopstoolkit.live as perfect match ✨
```

**Get Started**: See the [Tools and Features Overview](./docs/mcp-tools-overview.md) for complete guide to all available tools including capability management, deployment recommendations, and workflow integration.

### Documentation Testing & Validation
📖 **Automated Testing**: Validates documentation by executing commands and testing examples  
🔍 **Two-Phase Validation**: Tests both functionality (does it work?) and semantic accuracy (are descriptions truthful?)  
🛠️ **Fix Application**: User-driven selection and application of recommended documentation improvements  
💾 **Session Management**: Resumable testing workflows for large documentation sets

### Organizational Pattern Management
🏛️ **Pattern Creation**: Define organizational deployment patterns that capture institutional knowledge  
🧠 **AI Enhancement**: Patterns automatically enhance deployment recommendations with organizational context  
🔍 **Semantic Search**: Uses Vector DB technology for intelligent pattern matching based on user intent  
📋 **Best Practices**: Share deployment standards across teams through reusable patterns

### Policy Management & Governance
🛡️ **Policy Creation**: Define governance policies that guide users toward compliant configurations  
⚠️ **Compliance Integration**: Policies create required questions with compliance indicators during deployment  
🤖 **Kyverno Generation**: Automatically generates Kyverno ClusterPolicies for active enforcement  
🎯 **Proactive Governance**: Prevents configuration drift by embedding compliance into the recommendation workflow

### Shared Prompts Library
🎯 **Native Slash Commands**: Prompts appear as `/dot-ai:prompt-name` in your coding agent  
📚 **Curated Library**: Access proven prompts for code review, documentation, architecture, and project management  
🔄 **Zero Setup**: Connect to MCP server and prompts are immediately available across all projects  
🤝 **Team Consistency**: Standardized prompt usage with centralized management

### AI Integration
⚡ **MCP Integration**: Works seamlessly with Claude Code, Cursor, or VS Code through Model Context Protocol  
🤖 **Conversational Interface**: Natural language interaction for deployment, documentation testing, pattern management, and shared prompt workflows

**Setup Required**: See the [MCP Setup Guide](./docs/mcp-setup.md) for complete configuration instructions.

This video explains the platform engineering problem and demonstrates the Kubernetes deployment recommendation workflow from intent to running applications.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

**For Kubernetes deployment and documentation testing:**
- **Claude API key** (required for AI analysis)
  - Get your API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) (requires account login)
  <!-- dotai-ignore: Console URL may return 403 - expected behavior for auth-protected endpoint -->
  - Set it as environment variable: `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`

**For shared prompts library:**
- **No API key required** - Works with any MCP-enabled coding agent (other features like deployments do require ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)

**For Kubernetes deployment recommendations:**
- **kubectl** configured with cluster access
  - Verify cluster access with: `kubectl get nodes`
  - Should show your cluster nodes without authentication errors
<!-- dotai-ignore: kubectl verification command output format - implementation-specific -->

**For documentation testing:**
- **Documentation files** to test (Markdown, HTML, etc.)
- **File system access** to the documentation you want to validate

**For organizational pattern management:**
- **Vector DB service** (Qdrant) for pattern storage and semantic search
- **OpenAI API key** (required) for semantic pattern matching and vector operations
- See the [Pattern Management Guide](./docs/pattern-management-guide.md) for complete setup

**For policy management and governance:**
- **Vector DB service** (Qdrant) for policy storage and semantic search
- **OpenAI API key** (required) for semantic policy matching and vector operations  
- **Optional**: Kyverno installed in cluster for active policy enforcement
- See the [Policy Management Guide](./docs/policy-management-guide.md) for complete setup

4. **Use conversational workflows:**

**Example: Kubernetes Deployment**
```
User: I want to deploy a web application to my cluster

Agent: I'll help you deploy a web application. Let me get recommendations. First, a few questions to provide better suggestions:

What type of web application is this? Is it for development or production? 
Does it need external access?
[Uses recommend tool for clarification]

User: It's a production Node.js API that needs external access

Agent: Perfect! Based on your production requirements, I found 3 deployment options. 
Let's use the Production Web Stack with external access.
What's your application name and container image?
[Uses recommend tool with refined intent]

User: App name is "myapp" and image is "myapp:v1.0.0"

Agent: Excellent! Generating production-ready manifests and deploying...
[Uses chooseSolution, answerQuestion, generateManifests, deployManifests]

Agent: ✅ Successfully deployed! Your production API is running with external access.
```

**Example: Capability Management**
```
User: I want to scan my cluster for resource capabilities to improve recommendations

Agent: I'll help you scan your cluster to discover semantic capabilities. This will dramatically improve recommendation accuracy.
[Uses manageOrgData with capabilities scanning]

Agent: Would you like to scan all cluster resources or specify a subset?
Options: 1) All resources 2) Specific subset

User: All resources in auto mode

Agent: Starting comprehensive cluster capability scan...
✅ Capability scan completed! Processed cluster resources successfully.

User: Now I need a PostgreSQL database

Agent: Let me get enhanced recommendations using your capability data.
[Uses recommend tool with capability pre-filtering]

Agent: Perfect! I found sqls.devopstoolkit.live as the top match - it's a managed database solution supporting PostgreSQL with multi-cloud capabilities and low complexity. Much better than the generic StatefulSet approach I would have suggested before!
```

**Example: Policy Management**
```
User: I want to create a policy requiring resource limits on all deployments

Agent: I'll help you create a governance policy for resource limits. Let me start the creation workflow.
[Uses manageOrgData with policy creation]

Agent: Please describe your resource limits policy intent:

User: All container deployments must have CPU and memory limits to prevent resource exhaustion. CPU limits should be between 100m-2000m, memory between 128Mi-4Gi.

Agent: Excellent! I've created your Resource Limits Policy and generated a Kyverno ClusterPolicy for enforcement. 

Would you like to:
1. Store policy intent only (for AI guidance)  
2. Apply Kyverno policy to cluster (active enforcement)

User: Apply the Kyverno policy for active enforcement

Agent: ✅ Policy deployed! Now when users deploy applications, they'll get required questions for CPU/memory limits with your specified ranges, and any non-compliant deployments will be blocked by Kyverno.
```

**Example: Documentation Testing**
```
User: I want to test my README.md file to make sure all the examples work

Agent: I'll help you test your README.md for accuracy. Let me start a documentation testing session.
[Uses testDocs tool]

Agent: Found 6 testable sections in your README. Testing installation instructions...

✅ npm install command works correctly
❌ Configuration example has wrong port number (8080 vs 3000)
⚠️  Claims "works out of the box" but requires additional setup

Which issues would you like me to help you fix?

User: Fix the port number directly in the doc, and I'll create a GitHub issue for the setup requirements.

Agent: ✅ Documentation testing complete! Fixed 1 issue directly, 1 issue tracked externally.
```

*Note: Conversational examples are illustrative - actual AI responses will vary based on specific context and implementation.*

**Example: Shared Prompts Library**
```
# Conversational approach
User: I want to create a new PRD for a feature

Agent: I'll help you create a documentation-first PRD. Let me start the process.
[Uses prd-create prompt via /dot-ai:prd-create]

Agent: Great! I've created GitHub issue #34 and the PRD file. What feature would you like to document?

# Direct slash command approach  
User: /dot-ai:prd-create

Agent: I'm executing the PRD creation workflow. Please describe the feature you want to create a PRD for...
```
