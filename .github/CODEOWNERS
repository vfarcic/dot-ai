# CODEOWNERS
#
# Code owners are automatically requested for review when someone opens a pull request
# that modifies code that they own. Code owners are not automatically requested to review
# draft pull requests.
#
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners

# Global owners (default for everything in the repository)
# Using individual maintainers for code ownership
* @vfarcic

# Notes:
# - Code owners are automatically requested for review when PRs modify their files
# - You can define path-specific owners by adding lines like:
#   /docs/ @docs-team
#   /.github/ @devops-team
#   /src/core/ @architecture-team
# - Order matters: later matches take precedence over earlier ones
# - Use teams (@org/team) for easier maintenance in larger projects
