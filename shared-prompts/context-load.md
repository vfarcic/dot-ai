# Load Context

Load context from tmp/context.md to continue previous work session.

Steps:
1. Read the context file from `tmp/context.md`
2. Analyze the saved context to understand:
   - What work was completed previously
   - Current status and next steps
   - Available test data and file locations
   - Technical implementation details
3. Provide a brief summary of the loaded context
4. Ask the user how they'd like to proceed based on the context
