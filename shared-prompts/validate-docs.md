# Validate Documentation

What documentation do you want to validate?

**Examples:**
- "Validate my README.md file"
- "Validate all markdown files in the docs/ directory"
- "Validate API documentation for broken links and examples"
- "Validate installation guide for outdated commands"
- "Validate tutorial documentation for accuracy"

**Your validation request**: [Please specify which documentation files you want to validate]

---

Once you specify the documentation, I'll call the `testDocs` tool to analyze your files for accuracy, functionality, broken examples, outdated commands, invalid links, and overall quality.
