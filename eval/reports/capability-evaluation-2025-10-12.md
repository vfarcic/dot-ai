## Detailed Scenario Results

### 1. CAPABILITY-COMPARATIVE CAPABILITY AUTO SCAN

**Winner**: vercel_claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 (Score: 91.45)  
**Models Compared**: 2  
**Confidence**: 90%

#### Rankings
1. **vercel_claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929** - 91.45
2. **vercel_gpt-5** - 83.85

#### Analysis
vercel_claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 emerges as the clear superior model for Kubernetes capability analysis, achieving a 91.45 weighted score versus 83.85 for vercel_gpt-5. The decisive factors are reliability (claude completed successfully in 6 minutes vs. gpt-5's 30-minute timeout), consistency (95 vs 65), and clarity (95 vs 85). While gpt-5 provides more exhaustive capability enumerations (completeness: 92 vs 85), this verbosity contributed to its timeout failure and reduced practical utility. Claude strikes the optimal balance between technical accuracy, comprehensive coverage, user accessibility, and production reliability. For operational Kubernetes capability inference workflows, claude-sonnet is the recommended choice due to its proven ability to deliver high-quality, consistent analyses within reasonable time constraints. The timeout failure of gpt-5, despite its technical depth, represents a critical reliability concern that disqualifies it for production use in time-sensitive capability analysis scenarios.

### 2. CAPABILITY-COMPARATIVE CAPABILITY CRUD AUTO SCAN

**Winner**: vercel_gpt-5 (Score: 91.75)  
**Models Compared**: 2  
**Confidence**: 90%

#### Rankings
1. **vercel_gpt-5** - 91.75
2. **vercel_claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929** - 85.05

#### Analysis
vercel_gpt-5 demonstrates superior capability inference for Kubernetes resources, providing comprehensive technical accuracy that captures the full breadth of resource functionality. Its granular analysis identifies 2-3x more capabilities than Claude Sonnet while maintaining technical correctness. vercel_claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 offers more accessible descriptions and faster processing but sacrifices critical completeness, missing advanced features like dual-stack networking, traffic policies, immutability controls, and session affinity that are essential for production Kubernetes deployments. For capability analysis requiring technical depth and completeness, GPT-5 is the clear choice despite longer processing times. Claude Sonnet is better suited for high-level overviews where speed and clarity trump comprehensive feature coverage. Both models show consistent quality across resources, but GPT-5's depth makes it more suitable for documentation, API design, and technical decision-making.

### 3. CAPABILITY-COMPARATIVE CAPABILITY LIST AUTO SCAN

**Winner**: vercel_gpt-5 (Score: 92.05)  
**Models Compared**: 2  
**Confidence**: 90%

#### Rankings
1. **vercel_gpt-5** - 92.05
2. **vercel_claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929** - 84.85

#### Analysis
vercel_gpt-5 provides superior capability analysis for Kubernetes Services with comprehensive coverage of both basic and advanced features, making it more valuable for production users who need complete understanding of available capabilities. The model demonstrates deep technical knowledge with 17 specific capabilities including critical features like dual-stack networking, traffic policy controls, and session affinity that are essential for modern Kubernetes deployments. vercel_claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 excels in clarity and efficiency with significantly faster response time and more accessible descriptions, making it better suited for quick overviews or novice users. However, its omission of multiple important capabilities and the technical inaccuracy of including 'network policy' as a Service abstraction reduce its completeness score. For capability analysis workflows requiring comprehensive feature identification, vercel_gpt-5 is the stronger choice despite being more verbose. For quick reference documentation or introductory materials, vercel_claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929's clarity advantages may be preferred, but the completeness gaps should be addressed.

### 4. CAPABILITY-COMPARATIVE CAPABILITY SEARCH AUTO SCAN

**Winner**: vercel_gpt-5 (Score: 89.35)  
**Models Compared**: 2  
**Confidence**: 90%

#### Rankings
1. **vercel_gpt-5** - 89.35
2. **vercel_claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929** - 85.05

#### Analysis
Both models demonstrate strong Kubernetes knowledge but optimize for different use cases. GPT-5 provides encyclopedic capability coverage with exceptional technical accuracy, making it ideal for comprehensive capability discovery, documentation generation, and advanced user scenarios despite slower performance. Claude Sonnet 4.5 delivers highly accessible, consistent analyses with excellent production performance, making it superior for quick lookups and beginner-to-intermediate users, but sacrifices completeness for clarity. For the stated 'capability_search_auto_scan' scenario requiring thorough capability inference, GPT-5's comprehensive approach edges out Claude's accessible but less complete analysis. The 13x performance difference is notable but secondary to accuracy and completeness in capability discovery contexts.
