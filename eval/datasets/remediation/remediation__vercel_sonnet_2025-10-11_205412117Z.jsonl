GPT-5 emerges as the optimal production model by leveraging cache effectively and maintaining fast response times without sacrificing diagnostic quality. GPT-5-pro's exhaustive analysis comes at an unsustainable performance cost - its 12-minute response time would be unacceptable in incident response scenarios. Claude showed good instincts with broader cluster investigation but suffered from scope creep and token inefficiency. The scenario demonstrates that for Kubernetes troubleshooting, models must balance three concerns: (1) accurate root cause identification, (2) speed to resolution, and (3) resource efficiency. Cache utilization emerged as a key differentiator - GPT-5's 22K cached tokens enabled both speed and efficiency. For real-world SRE workflows, sub-60-second response times with <30K tokens (GPT-5's profile) represent the sweet spot, while 10+ minute analyses (GPT-5-pro) break operational flow despite superior depth.\"\n}\n```","performance":{"duration_ms":34683,"input_tokens":2246,"output_tokens":1541,"total_tokens":3787,"sdk":"vercel","model_version":"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929","iterations":1,"tool_calls_executed":0,"cache_read_tokens":0,"cache_creation_tokens":0},"metadata":{"timestamp":"2025-10-11T20:54:12.117Z","complexity":"medium","tags":["troubleshooting"],"source":"integration_test","tool":"remediation","test_scenario":"remediation-comparative-remediate_manual_execute","failure_analysis":""}}
