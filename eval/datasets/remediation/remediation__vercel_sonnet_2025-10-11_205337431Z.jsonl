Claude demonstrates that superior optimization doesn't require sacrificing diagnostic accuracy - achieving the fastest time and lowest resource usage while matching or exceeding competitors in root cause identification. GPT-5's cache strategy represents a middle ground, trading some tokens for thorough investigation. GPT-5-Pro's exhaustive approach produces excellent documentation but at prohibitive computational cost. For production Kubernetes troubleshooting, the 15x speed difference between Claude (31s) and GPT-5-Pro (488s) is decisive - incident response demands rapid diagnosis. All three models correctly identified the OOMKilled root cause and proposed identical remediation commands, validating that efficiency gains don't compromise solution quality. The key differentiator is the path efficiency: Claude reached the correct solution most directly. Cache utilization emerges as a critical optimization strategy, with models using caching (GPT-5, Claude) significantly outperforming the non-caching approach. Risk assessment varied interestingly, with GPT-5's 'medium' rating being most production-realistic for memory changes that could affect scheduling and node resources.\"\n}\n```","performance":{"duration_ms":33779,"input_tokens":2446,"output_tokens":1458,"total_tokens":3904,"sdk":"vercel","model_version":"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929","iterations":1,"tool_calls_executed":0,"cache_read_tokens":0,"cache_creation_tokens":0},"metadata":{"timestamp":"2025-10-11T20:53:37.431Z","complexity":"medium","tags":["troubleshooting"],"source":"integration_test","tool":"remediation","test_scenario":"remediation-comparative-remediate_manual_analyze","failure_analysis":""}}
