{"input":{"issue":"auto-test-pod in remediate-auto-test namespace is crashing","setup_context":""},"output":"Perfect. The pod uses the default service account which exists. Since I've validated the delete operation successfully, and I have the correct manifest structure based on the describe output, I can provide the remediation.
