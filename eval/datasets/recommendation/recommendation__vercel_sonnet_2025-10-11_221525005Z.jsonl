GPT-5 demonstrates deeper PostgreSQL/CloudNativePG expertise and generates more thorough questions, but its performance characteristics (6.8-minute response time, 70K tokens) make it unsuitable for real-time user interactions. Claude Sonnet strikes a superior balance - it covers 85-90% of the important configuration concerns while responding 2.6x faster with better UX through hint fields. For question generation phases in production systems, the winner must be fast enough to keep users engaged while comprehensive enough to gather necessary information. Claude Sonnet achieves this balance; GPT-5 does not. The performance weight of 20% may actually undervalue the importance of response time in user-facing applications - a 7-minute wait would cause most users to abandon the workflow entirely, rendering even perfect questions useless. Both models successfully adapt their questions across different PostgreSQL deployment scenarios (HA cluster, staging, simple StatefulSet), showing good contextual awareness.\"\n}\n```","performance":{"duration_ms":34957,"input_tokens":25047,"output_tokens":1432,"total_tokens":26479,"sdk":"vercel","model_version":"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929","iterations":1,"tool_calls_executed":0,"cache_read_tokens":0,"cache_creation_tokens":0},"metadata":{"timestamp":"2025-10-11T22:15:25.005Z","complexity":"medium","tags":["troubleshooting"],"source":"integration_test","tool":"recommendation","test_scenario":"recommendation-comparative-recommend_question_generation","failure_analysis":""}}
