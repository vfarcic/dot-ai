GPT-5's encyclopedic 46-point coverage demonstrates deep database operations knowledge but fails on multiple practical dimensions: the 20-minute workflow timeout is a disqualifying reliability issue, the 132-second response is too slow for interactive workflows, and the 7,778 tokens create cognitive overload. Claude's 23-point approach proves that strategic prioritization beats exhaustive enumeration - it covers all critical requirements while remaining actionable and completing reliably. The efficiency gap is stark: Claude delivers 85% of the quality in 42% of the time using 41% of the tokens, while actually completing the full workflow successfully. For production deployment tooling, reliability and efficiency are not optional - a system that times out or takes 2+ minutes per phase cannot serve real users effectively. Claude's approach of 'comprehensive but focused' proves superior to 'exhaustive but overwhelming' in this practical engineering context.\"\n}\n```","performance":{"duration_ms":33216,"input_tokens":10604,"output_tokens":1344,"total_tokens":11948,"sdk":"vercel","model_version":"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929","iterations":1,"tool_calls_executed":0,"cache_read_tokens":0,"cache_creation_tokens":0},"metadata":{"timestamp":"2025-10-11T22:14:18.917Z","complexity":"medium","tags":["troubleshooting"],"source":"integration_test","tool":"recommendation","test_scenario":"recommendation-comparative-recommend_clarification_phase","failure_analysis":""}}
