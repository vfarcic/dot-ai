This severe performance penalty (receiving 0.45/1.0 on 20% weighted performance) drops it to second place despite excellent quality and efficiency scores.

GPT-5 produces more maintainable, consolidated policies with flexible validation logic - ideal for expert platform teams who can tolerate longer generation times. Claude produces more prescriptive, verbose policies but delivers them 4.8x faster, making it more suitable for interactive policy workflows and self-service governance platforms. Key differentiators: (1) Performance gap is extreme (37s vs 181s) - Claude's speed enables real-time policy iteration while GPT-5's latency disrupts workflow; (2) Validation philosophy differs - GPT-5's 'any limits present' approach offers flexibility while Claude's 'CPU+memory required' provides stronger governance; (3) Policy structure - GPT-5's 3 consolidated rules vs Claude's 8 separate rules represents 62% less policy code but both are functionally complete; (4) Resource coverage - Claude caught CNPG Cluster while GPT-5 missed it, but GPT-5 has better ephemeral container coverage. For production organizational policy management, response time and user experience are paramount - Claude's performance advantage outweighs GPT-5's engineering sophistication, making it the better choice for interactive policy platforms despite higher maintenance overhead from rule duplication.\"\n}\n```","performance":{"duration_ms":32274,"input_tokens":7005,"output_tokens":1373,"total_tokens":8378,"sdk":"vercel","model_version":"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929","iterations":1,"tool_calls_executed":0,"cache_read_tokens":0,"cache_creation_tokens":0},"metadata":{"timestamp":"2025-10-12T18:31:57.962Z","complexity":"medium","tags":["troubleshooting"],"source":"integration_test","tool":"policy","test_scenario":"policy-comparative-policy_namespace_scope_step","failure_analysis":""}}
