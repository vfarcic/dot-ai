Targeting only Deployments while excluding StatefulSets and other replica-capable resources creates significant coverage gaps for organizational high-availability requirements. The 110-second execution time is unacceptable for production policy validation workflows.

Claude adopts a 'wide net' approach covering 6 resource types (including CRDs), ensuring organizational HA intent applies across the entire workload ecosystem - the correct interpretation for enterprise governance. GPT-5 takes a 'narrow precision' approach with stricter validation (>= 2 replicas) but critically under-scopes to only Deployments. For organizational policy management, breadth of coverage is more valuable than narrow perfection - missing StatefulSets in an HA policy creates significant governance gaps. Performance differences are dramatic: Claude's 4x speed advantage (27s vs 110s) directly impacts user experience and production viability. Both models demonstrate strong schema analysis capabilities, but Claude's interpretation better aligns with real-world Kubernetes governance needs where HA requirements must span all replica-based workload types. The ideal solution would combine Claude's comprehensive scope with GPT-5's minimum value validation (>= 2), while potentially excluding deprecated/system-managed resources to reduce noise.\"\n}\n```","performance":{"duration_ms":33963,"input_tokens":4665,"output_tokens":1349,"total_tokens":6014,"sdk":"vercel","model_version":"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929","iterations":1,"tool_calls_executed":0,"cache_read_tokens":0,"cache_creation_tokens":0},"metadata":{"timestamp":"2025-10-12T18:32:31.928Z","complexity":"medium","tags":["troubleshooting"],"source":"integration_test","tool":"policy","test_scenario":"policy-comparative-policy_store_only_namespace_scope","failure_analysis":""}}
