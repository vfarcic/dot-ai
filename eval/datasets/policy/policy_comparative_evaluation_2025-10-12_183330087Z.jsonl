While the granular coverage of container types and platform-specific resources demonstrates thoroughness, the lack of structure, poor organization, and extreme latency significantly diminish its utility. The response reads as an exhaustive brainstorm rather than a curated, policy-focused resource list. For organizational policy management where workflow efficiency and user experience are paramount, the performance penalty is disqualifying despite reasonable content quality.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"overall_insights\": \"This evaluation reveals a critical trade-off between comprehensive breadth and practical utility in policy management workflows. Model performance (response time) proved decisive - a 52-second delay for a simple enumeration task indicates severe scalability issues for interactive policy creation tools. The superior model (Claude) demonstrated better understanding of policy enforcement priorities by including resource governance constructs (HPA, VPA, QoS, quotas) that directly impact policy evaluation, while the slower model focused on exhaustive enumeration without prioritization. For Kubernetes organizational policy intent management, models must balance: (1) coverage of policy-relevant resources, (2) focus on governance and constraint mechanisms, (3) response times suitable for interactive workflows, and (4) structured output enabling downstream policy rule generation. The 14x performance difference between models for this foundational workflow step suggests significant architectural differences that would compound across multi-step policy creation workflows. Organizations should prioritize models that understand the policy enforcement context (not just Kubernetes resources) and can deliver sub-5-second responses for workflow steps to maintain acceptable user experience.\"\n}\n```","performance":{"duration_ms":28900,"input_tokens":1359,"output_tokens":1240,"total_tokens":2599,"sdk":"vercel","model_version":"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929","iterations":1,"tool_calls_executed":0,"cache_read_tokens":0,"cache_creation_tokens":0},"metadata":{"timestamp":"2025-10-12T18:33:30.087Z","complexity":"medium","tags":["troubleshooting"],"source":"integration_test","tool":"policy","test_scenario":"policy-comparative-policy_triggers_step","failure_analysis":""}}
