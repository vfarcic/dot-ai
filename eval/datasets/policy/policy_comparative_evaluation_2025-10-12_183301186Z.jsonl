Claude Sonnet demonstrated superior platform understanding, maintaining strict Kubernetes focus while GPT-5 exhibited concerning platform confusion. The 22x performance difference (3.2s vs 70.1s) is particularly significant for policy workflows that may involve multiple evaluation steps. Both models defaulted to list-based responses without structure or explanation, suggesting that neither was optimized for guided policy creation workflows. However, Claude's efficiency and accuracy make it far more suitable for production Kubernetes policy management. The scenario highlights that broader knowledge (GPT-5's multi-platform awareness) can be counterproductive when precision and focus are required. For organizational policy intent management, models must balance comprehensiveness with platform-specific accuracy - Claude achieved this balance while GPT-5 did not. Future improvements for both models should include structured categorization, explanatory context, and explicit rationale for why specific resources trigger policy evaluation.\"\n}\n```","performance":{"duration_ms":29256,"input_tokens":1357,"output_tokens":1282,"total_tokens":2639,"sdk":"vercel","model_version":"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929","iterations":1,"tool_calls_executed":0,"cache_read_tokens":0,"cache_creation_tokens":0},"metadata":{"timestamp":"2025-10-12T18:33:01.186Z","complexity":"medium","tags":["troubleshooting"],"source":"integration_test","tool":"policy","test_scenario":"policy-comparative-policy_store_only_triggers","failure_analysis":""}}
