GPT-5 provides encyclopedic capability coverage with exceptional technical accuracy, making it ideal for comprehensive capability discovery, documentation generation, and advanced user scenarios despite slower performance. Claude Sonnet 4.5 delivers highly accessible, consistent analyses with excellent production performance, making it superior for quick lookups and beginner-to-intermediate users, but sacrifices completeness for clarity. For the stated 'capability_search_auto_scan' scenario requiring thorough capability inference, GPT-5's comprehensive approach edges out Claude's accessible but less complete analysis. The 13x performance difference is notable but secondary to accuracy and completeness in capability discovery contexts.\"\n}\n```","performance":{"duration_ms":23992,"input_tokens":2648,"output_tokens":1057,"total_tokens":3705,"sdk":"vercel","model_version":"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929","iterations":1,"tool_calls_executed":0,"cache_read_tokens":0,"cache_creation_tokens":0},"metadata":{"timestamp":"2025-10-12T04:12:45.570Z","complexity":"medium","tags":["troubleshooting"],"source":"integration_test","tool":"capability","test_scenario":"capability-comparative-capability_search_auto_scan","failure_analysis":""}}
