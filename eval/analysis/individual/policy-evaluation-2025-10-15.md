**Winner**: vercel_gemini-2.5-pro (Score: 0.82)  
**Models Compared**: 9  
**Confidence**: 90%

#### Rankings
1. **vercel_gemini-2.5-pro** - 0.82
2. **vercel_claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929** - 0.85
3. **vercel_gemini-2.5-flash** - 0.8
4. **vercel_grok-4** - 0.79

7. **vercel_grok-4-fast-reasoning** - 0.23
8. **vercel_deepseek-reasoner** - 0
9. **vercel_mistral-large-latest** - 0

#### Analysis
This scenario exposed critical differences in model capabilities for Kubernetes policy generation. Key findings: (1) Context Length Crisis - Two models (DeepSeek, Mistral) completely failed due to context limits, highlighting that large schema contexts (~140K tokens) exceed many models' capabilities. (2) Validation Method Matters - Models split between modern CEL expressions (Sonnet, Gemini, GPT-5, Grok) and deprecated pattern validation (Haiku). CEL is the correct approach. (3) HA Understanding Gap - Critical difference between checking field presence vs. enforcing minimum values. Only Gemini-2.5-Pro, Grok-4, and GPT-5 correctly enforced replicas >= 2. Sonnet only checked field existence. (4) Performance vs. Quality Tradeoff - Slower models (GPT-5: 56s, Grok-4: 85s, Gemini-Pro: 49s) often had better policy quality, while faster models (Gemini-Flash: 11.8s, Sonnet: 28s) sometimes missed requirements. (5) Production Viability - Grok-4-Fast-Reasoning's formatting errors and extremely slow performance (156s) demonstrate that speed claims don't guarantee usability. (6) Schema Analysis Quality - Best models performed comprehensive schema-by-schema analysis identifying all workload controllers with replica fields. Gemini-2.5-Pro uniquely identified HPA minReplicas importance. (7) Winner: Gemini-2.5-Pro provides the most comprehensive HA policy despite slower performance, correctly understanding that HA requires both base replicas >= 2 AND HPA minReplicas > 1 where applicable. For production use requiring fast iteration, Gemini-2.5-Flash offers best speed/quality tradeoff despite missing >= 2 enforcement.

10. **vercel_gpt-5-pro** - 0

#### Analysis
This evaluation reveals critical tradeoffs between quality, efficiency, and performance in policy intent management. The top performers (Gemini-2.5-Pro, Claude-Haiku, Grok-4-Fast-Reasoning) achieve strong quality while maintaining practical response times. A clear pattern emerges: models that over-reason (DeepSeek-Reasoner: 167s) or attempt excessive comprehensiveness (Gemini-Flash, GPT-5) sacrifice efficiency without proportional quality gains. The catastrophic failure of GPT-5-Pro highlights the critical importance of reliability in production policy workflows. For Kubernetes organizational policy management, teams should prioritize models that balance Kubernetes-native accuracy with user-friendly synonyms while maintaining sub-5-second response times. The best models (Gemini-2.5-Pro, Claude-Haiku) demonstrate that concise, focused outputs with core controllers (StatefulSets, ReplicaSets, Deployments, DaemonSets) plus policy-relevant resources (HorizontalPodAutoscaler, PodDisruptionBudget) provide optimal value. Cross-platform coverage (GPT-5) may be valuable for multi-cloud environments but should be opt-in to avoid diluting Kubernetes-focused workflows. Performance consistency matters more than peak quality when rapid policy intent capture is required for organizational governance workflows.

10. **vercel_deepseek-reasoner** - 0.598

#### Analysis
The evaluation reveals critical performance trade-offs in policy trigger generation: (1) Claude Haiku and Mistral Large demonstrate that speed and comprehensiveness aren't mutually exclusive - both deliver excellent coverage in under 3 seconds; (2) Reasoning models (DeepSeek Reasoner, GPT-5-Pro) show catastrophic latency issues for workflow steps requiring quick responses, with timeouts making them unsuitable for interactive policy management; (3) The best models balance breadth (workload types, resource constraints, enforcement mechanisms) with depth (QoS classes, admission controllers, container variations); (4) Response time matters significantly - even good quality responses lose value when they take 20-135 seconds for simple trigger lists; (5) Structure and categorization (as shown by Mistral) improve usability without sacrificing speed; (6) Models that include enforcement mechanisms (admission controllers, limit ranges, QoS classes) demonstrate deeper understanding of Kubernetes policy architecture versus those listing only workload types; (7) For production policy management workflows, sub-5-second responses with comprehensive trigger coverage (Claude Haiku, Mistral Large) are the gold standard - anything over 10 seconds becomes a UX liability regardless of quality.

## AI Model Selection Guide


### Key Insights
This evaluation reveals four critical patterns: (1) Context Window Crisis - 40% of models suffer catastrophic failures on large schema contexts (~140K tokens), with GPT-5-Pro, DeepSeek-Reasoner, and Mistral-Large showing 25-50% failure rates. This is a non-negotiable requirement for production Kubernetes policy work. (2) Reliability Paradox - Peak performance matters less than consistency. Gemini-2.5-Pro wins 2 scenarios but Sonnet's zero-failure record makes it more production-ready. (3) Speed vs. Quality Tradeoff - Fast models (Haiku, Gemini-Flash: <12s) sacrifice depth, while slow models (DeepSeek: 167s) sacrifice usability. The sweet spot is 28-49s deliberate analysis. (4) CEL Mastery Separates Tiers - Top performers (Sonnet, Gemini-Flash, GPT-5, Grok-4) demonstrate modern CEL validation expertise vs. deprecated pattern validation, showing architectural maturity. For production Kubernetes policy automation, teams must prioritize: 150K+ context windows, 100% scenario participation, sub-60s response times, and modern CEL validation capabilities. The 40% failure rate demonstrates this remains a specialized domain where general-purpose models without sufficient context capacity pose catastrophic operational risks.

### Recommended Selection Strategy
- **For Production Use**: Choose vercel_claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 - Most reliable all-around performer with zero failures, consistent excellence across all policy generation tasks, optimal response times, and proven CEL validation expertise. Best choice for production environments requiring dependable Kubernetes policy automation.
- **For Secondary Option**: Consider vercel_gemini-2.5-pro - Best choice when policy comprehensiveness matters more than speed. Superior HA policy understanding and schema analysis make it ideal for complex compliance requirements, though slower response times require consideration for interactive workflows.
- **Avoid**: vercel_gpt-5-pro - 50% failure rate, worst average score (0.301), completely unreliable for production, vercel_deepseek-reasoner - 50% failure rate, catastrophic latency (167s), context window failures make it unsuitable for schema-heavy tasks, vercel_mistral-large-latest - 25% failure rate due to context limits, cannot handle large schema contexts required for production Kubernetes policy work (reliability concerns)

### Decision Framework
The AI assessment prioritizes **reliability and consistency** over peak performance. Models that fail completely in any scenario are heavily penalized, ensuring production-ready recommendations.
