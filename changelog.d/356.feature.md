## Knowledge Base System

Ingest, search, and query organizational knowledge from any source. Organizations often have valuable documentation scattered across Git repositories, wikis, and internal systems that AI assistants cannot access for context-aware recommendations.

The `manageKnowledge` MCP tool provides three operations: `ingest` accepts document content with a source URI and automatically chunks it using semantic-aware text splitting, generating embeddings for vector storage; `search` performs semantic search across all ingested documents with optional URI filtering; `deleteByUri` removes all chunks for a specific document. Documents are automatically chunked at 1000 characters with 200 character overlap for context continuity. Re-ingesting a document automatically replaces previous chunks, handling cases where documents shrink without leaving orphan data.

The HTTP API at `POST /api/v1/knowledge/ask` provides AI-synthesized answers for applications without built-in AI capability. The endpoint uses an agentic loop that can search multiple times to find relevant information, then synthesizes a natural language answer with source citations. A separate `DELETE /api/v1/knowledge/source/:sourceIdentifier` endpoint enables bulk deletion of all documents from a specific source, useful for GitKnowledgeSource cleanup operations.

The `version` tool now reports knowledge-base collection status alongside other vector collections, showing whether the collection exists and how many chunks are stored.
