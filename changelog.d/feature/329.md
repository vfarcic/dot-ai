**PostHog Telemetry for Usage Analytics**

Anonymous usage telemetry helps improve dot-ai by tracking which tools are used, what errors occur, and which AI providers are popular. No personally identifiable information, queries, or cluster data is collected.

Telemetry is enabled by default. Set `DOT_AI_TELEMETRY=false` to opt out. See the [Telemetry Guide](https://devopstoolkit.ai/docs/mcp/guides/telemetry-guide/) for full details on what's collected and privacy controls.
