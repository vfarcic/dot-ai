## On-Demand Prompts Cache Refresh

Force-refresh the prompts cache without restarting the pod or waiting for TTL expiry. Previously, when prompts were updated in a git repository configured via `DOT_AI_USER_PROMPTS_REPO`, users had to wait for the cache TTL to expire or restart the pod to pick up changes.

The new `POST /api/v1/prompts/refresh` endpoint triggers an immediate git pull and reloads all prompts into the cache. The response includes the count of loaded prompts and source information. The endpoint appears in the OpenAPI spec, so the CLI automatically discovers it as `dot-ai prompts refresh` with no CLI changes required. This makes it easy to wire into git webhooks or call via `curl` during prompt development iterations.

If no user prompts repository is configured, the endpoint succeeds gracefully with a message indicating no user prompts repo is set.
