**Circuit Breaker for LLM API Rate Limits**

Embedding operations now include circuit breaker protection to gracefully handle rate limits and API quota errors. Previously, when rate limits hit, dot-ai would retry rapidly without backoff, generating hundreds of identical errors and wasting API budget before failing.

The circuit breaker monitors consecutive failures and temporarily blocks requests after 3 failures, giving the API time to recover. After a 30-second cooldown, it enters a half-open state to test if the service has recovered. Combined with the Vercel AI SDK's built-in exponential backoff (2s base delay with automatic `Retry-After` header support), this prevents cascading failures during sustained rate limit periods. Users see clear error messages when the circuit is open rather than repeated timeout errors.

The circuit breaker works automatically with no configuration required. Monitor circuit breaker state using the `getCircuitBreakerStats()` function exposed from the embedding service.
