## Qdrant Operations Plugin Migration

Vector database operations now run through the agentic-tools plugin instead of being embedded in the MCP server. This architectural change removes ~2,500 lines of Qdrant-specific code from the MCP server and consolidates all vector storage operations into a single plugin.

The plugin exposes 8 generic vector tools (vector_search, vector_store, vector_query, vector_get, vector_delete, vector_list, collection_initialize, collection_stats) that handle all storage mechanics. The MCP server remains responsible for embedding generation and domain logic, passing pre-computed vectors to the plugin. This separation enables future extensibility—users could swap Qdrant for another vector database by providing a plugin with the same interface.

Plugin tool invocation is now unified across the codebase via a central registry (`invokePluginTool()`), replacing inconsistent patterns where some tools received `pluginManager` as a parameter while others used module-level setters. All kubectl, helm, shell, and vector tools now use the same invocation pattern.

Qdrant configuration (`QDRANT_URL`, `QDRANT_API_KEY`) moves from MCP server to the agentic-tools plugin. Helm chart deployments handle this automatically.
