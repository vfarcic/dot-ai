## Helm Day-2 Operations

The `operate` and `remediate` tools now understand Helm releases, closing the gap between intelligent Helm installation and ongoing management. Previously, after installing third-party applications via the `recommend` tool, users had to drop to manual `helm` CLI commands for upgrades, rollbacks, and troubleshooting.

The `operate` tool detects when a target application is a Helm release and handles upgrades (with version selection and `--reuse-values` for safe value preservation), rollbacks to specific revisions, uninstalls with CRD warnings, and value modifications — all through the same intent-driven workflow used for other Kubernetes operations. Dry-run validation runs before any change is applied. The `remediate` tool now investigates Helm-specific issues during root cause analysis: stuck `pending-upgrade` states, failed hooks, revision conflicts, and other Helm release problems. It queries release status, history, and values to suggest targeted remediation such as rolling back to the last healthy revision.

Four new investigation tools (`helm_list`, `helm_status`, `helm_history`, `helm_get_values`) and a `helm_rollback` operation tool are available to the AI agent during analysis. The existing `helm_install` tool now supports Day-2 upgrades with `--reuse-values` enabled by default, and a new `helm_install_dryrun` variant enables safe validation during the analysis phase.
