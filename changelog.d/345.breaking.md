**Kubernetes-Only Deployment**

dot-ai now requires Kubernetes for deployment. Docker Compose, npx, and local standalone deployment options have been removed, along with ToolHive and kagent integration. This simplifies the codebase and documentation by establishing a single, consistent deployment model.

The MCP server now uses HTTP transport exclusively—stdio transport has been removed. Users who previously ran dot-ai locally with stdio must now deploy to a Kubernetes cluster and connect via HTTP. The `TRANSPORT_TYPE` environment variable is no longer supported.

All setup documentation has been consolidated into a single guide. Users should follow the [MCP Setup Guide](https://devopstoolkit.ai/docs/mcp/setup/mcp-setup) for installation and configuration. The guide covers Helm deployment, AI provider configuration, embedding setup, and MCP client configuration for Claude Code, Cursor, and other clients.
