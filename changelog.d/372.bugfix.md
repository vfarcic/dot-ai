## User Prompts No Longer Require Category Field

User prompts loaded from external git repositories now correctly load when their YAML frontmatter contains only `name` and `description`. Previously, prompts missing the `category` field were silently skipped during loading, causing the prompts API to return fewer prompts than expected with no error or warning to the caller.

The `category` field is now optional in prompt frontmatter validation, matching the fact that it was never included in API responses or used after parsing.
