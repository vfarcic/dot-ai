**Global Annotations Support in Helm Chart**

Apply custom annotations to all Kubernetes resources deployed by the Helm chart through a single `annotations` entry in values.yaml. Previously, adding annotations for tools like Reloader or compliance requirements meant manually editing manifests after deployment, using post-render hooks, or maintaining kustomize overlays—all of which added maintenance burden and were lost on chart upgrades.

The chart now supports a top-level `annotations` map that propagates to all rendered resources including Deployments, Services, ServiceAccounts, Secrets, RBAC resources, and pod templates. Pod template annotations are particularly important for Reloader integration, which watches for annotation changes to trigger rolling updates when ConfigMaps or Secrets change. For resources that already support their own annotations (Ingress, Gateway), global annotations merge with resource-specific ones, with resource-specific taking precedence on key conflicts.

Configure global annotations in your values file:
```yaml
annotations:
  reloader.stakater.com/auto: "true"
  company.com/managed-by: "platform-team"
```

See the [Kubernetes Setup Guide](https://devopstoolkit.ai/docs/mcp/setup/kubernetes-setup) for configuration details.
