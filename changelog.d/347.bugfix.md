**Plugin Tools No Longer Exposed as MCP Tools**

Plugin tools (kubectl_*, helm_*, shell_exec) are no longer registered as MCP tools. Previously, all 20+ plugin tools were exposed alongside the 7 built-in tools, consuming significant context tokens in AI clients even when users only needed core functionality.

Plugin tools remain available internally for built-in tools like remediate and query to use via pluginManager.invokeTool(). Only the 7 built-in MCP tools (recommend, version, manageOrgData, remediate, operate, projectSetup, query) are now exposed to clients, reducing context overhead and keeping the tool list focused on user-facing capabilities.
