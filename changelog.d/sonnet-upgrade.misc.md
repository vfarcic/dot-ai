## Claude Sonnet 4.6 Upgrade

The default Anthropic provider now uses Claude Sonnet 4.6 (`claude-sonnet-4-6`), replacing Claude Sonnet 4.5. Sonnet 4.6 delivers near-Opus intelligence with improved coding, long-context reasoning, and agent planning, while maintaining the same pricing tier. The Amazon Bedrock default model has also been updated to `global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6`.
