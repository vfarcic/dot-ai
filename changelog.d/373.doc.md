## Documentation Restructured into AI Engine and MCP Sections

Documentation now reflects the actual product architecture with two top-level sections instead of a single MCP-centric hierarchy. The previous structure implied MCP was the only way to use DevOps AI Toolkit — the new structure presents the AI Engine as the product and MCP as one of several access methods alongside CLI.

All tool guides (query, recommend, operate, remediate, etc.) now live under `ai-engine/tools/` with access-method-agnostic language. Setup documentation is split into server deployment (`ai-engine/setup/deployment.md`) and MCP client configuration (`mcp/index.md`). Organizational data guides (patterns, policies, concepts) are grouped under `ai-engine/organizational-data/`, and operations guides (observability, telemetry) under `ai-engine/operations/`. The old `guides/` and `setup/` directories with `mcp-` prefixed filenames are removed.

See the [AI Engine documentation](https://devopstoolkit.ai/docs/ai-engine) and [MCP setup guide](https://devopstoolkit.ai/docs/mcp).
