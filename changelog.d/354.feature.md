## REST API Route Registry with Complete OpenAPI Documentation

The REST API now provides complete OpenAPI documentation for all endpoints through a new route registry system. Previously, only tool endpoints (`/api/v1/tools/*`) were documented, while visualization, session, resource, and event endpoints lacked OpenAPI coverage. Adding new endpoints required manual updates to both the router and documentation, which frequently fell out of sync.

All REST endpoints are now defined in a centralized route registry with Zod schemas for request and response validation. The OpenAPI specification at `/api/v1/openapi` is auto-generated from these schemas, ensuring documentation always matches implementation. Endpoints for visualizations, sessions, resources, events, prompts, and tools are fully documented with accurate request/response schemas and error responses.

A mock server is available as a Docker image (`ghcr.io/vfarcic/dot-ai-mock-server:latest`) for integration testing and UI development. The mock server serves realistic fixture data for all endpoints, enabling Playwright tests and local development without a live cluster. Add it to docker-compose with `docker compose up mock-api` and point tests to `http://mock-api:3001`.
