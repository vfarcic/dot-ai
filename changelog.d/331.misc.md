**Towncrier Release Notes Infrastructure**

Release notes now contain meaningful descriptions of what changed and why, instead of just artifact versions and changelog links. Previously, releases provided no context about new features, bug fixes, or breaking changes—users had to dig through commit history to understand what a release contained.

The release workflow now uses towncrier to collect changelog fragments that accumulate as features merge, then combines them into rich release notes when a version is published. Contributors create simple markdown files in `changelog.d/` describing their changes, and the `/changelog-fragment` skill automates this during the `/prd-done` workflow. Release timing is now controlled—releases happen when maintainers push a version tag or trigger the workflow manually, not automatically on every merge.

The release workflow supports two modes: full releases (tag push or manual trigger) publish all artifacts with generated notes, while notes-only mode updates release descriptions without republishing artifacts—useful for retroactive cleanup of existing releases.
