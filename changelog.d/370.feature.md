## Claude Opus 4.6 Model Support

The default Anthropic Opus model is now Claude Opus 4.6, replacing Claude Opus 4.5. Opus 4.6 brings a 1M token context window (beta), 128K max output tokens, adaptive thinking controls, and improved agentic coding performance—all at the same pricing as Opus 4.5.

Set `AI_PROVIDER=anthropic_opus` to use the new model. No other configuration changes are required.
