**Reduced Excessive Logging During Circuit Breaker Events**

Fixed excessive log spam that occurred when the embedding API circuit breaker was open, which previously generated 130MB+ of logs within minutes from a single container. This caused log storage to fill rapidly, overwhelmed log aggregation systems (triggering Loki rate limiting), and made it difficult to find important logs.

The circuit breaker now logs "circuit open" warnings only once per open period instead of for every blocked request. Resource sync operations batch circuit breaker failures and log a summary count rather than individual warnings per resource. Per-resource progress logs during capability scans have been removed since progress is available via the dedicated progress endpoint. Command executor logging has been reduced to summary-level output.

These changes reduce log volume by 99%+ during circuit breaker scenarios while preserving all operationally important information.
