**Modular Plugin Architecture for kubectl Tools**

Kubernetes operations now run through a modular plugin system instead of being embedded in the MCP server core. This architectural change separates concerns, enables independent testing and deployment of kubectl tools, and lays the groundwork for user-provided plugins.

The `agentic-tools` plugin package contains all kubectl tools (kubectl_get, kubectl_apply, kubectl_describe, kubectl_logs, kubectl_events, kubectl_api_resources, kubectl_exec_command, and more) running as an HTTP service. The plugin communicates with the MCP server via describe/invoke hooks, allowing tools to be discovered at startup and invoked during agentic loops or direct API calls. The version tool now shows discovered plugin information including tool counts.

Plugin deployment is handled through the Helm chart. Plugins can be deployed by the chart (provide `image` + `port`) or registered externally (provide `endpoint` only). The MCP server itself no longer requires Kubernetes RBAC permissions since all cluster operations route through the plugin, which has its own ServiceAccount with appropriate permissions.
